	<div style="text-align:center;">A simple "one-click" program for users that quickly optimises and avoids detrimental conflicts in their Oblivion mod load order.</div>
    <br /><br />
	
	<div><span>Features</span>
	<ul>
		<li>Correctly positions over 9000 mods and counting, including all the mod files found in such popular mods as FCOM, OOO, MMM, Better Cities, Open Cities, Race Balancing Project and many other large mods.</li>
		<li>Checks all the mod files used in an 'FCOM Convergence' installation, including partial or complete installations of OOO, MMM, Fran's, Oblivion WarCry, Bob's Armory, Loth's Blunt Weapons for NPCs, Cobl, Tamriel Travellers, Exnem's Runeskulls and more.</li>
		<li>Detects common FCOM installation mistakes and warns the user about them.</li>
		<li>Differentiates between FCOM and non-FCOM setups.</li>
		<li>Provides Wrye Bash Bash Tag suggestions that are automatically applied by Wrye Bash.</li>
		<li>Provides useful load order notes for many mods.</li>
		<li>Displays the version number of mods when it is available.</li>
		<li>Sorts mod files ghosted by Wrye Bash.</li>
		<li>Is mostly right (most of the time)!</li>
		<li>Is under constant development and improvement by a team of modders and Oblivion experts.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Better Oblivion Sorting Software (BOSS) will reorder your mods to their correct positions (as listed in the masterlist.txt database file), putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.</p>
	<p>BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods such as FCOM and MMM, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there 
	(estimated at about 30,000) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of Oblivion mod load ordering is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.</p>
	</div>
	<br /><br />
	
	<div><span>Installation and Basic Usage</span>
	<ol>
		<li>If you have Wrye Bash, make sure the "Lock Times" function is deactivated.</li>
		<li>Wine users may need to run Winetricks to register the libraries properly. (thanks to John.Moonsugar for this info)</li>
		<li>Unzip the BOSS.zip to your ..\Oblivion\Data folder, so that BOSS.exe is in the same folder as your mods.</li>
		<li>Run BOSS.exe.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, FCOM installation errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. Wrye Bash will automatically import and apply Bash Tag 
	suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in Wrye Bash if necessary.</p>
	<p>You will need to reorder "unknown" mods by hand using OBMM or Wrye Bash.</p>
	<p>You can update your masterlist to the latest version by running the "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" file. This will replace your copy with the latest available online, and then run BOSS as normal using the updated masterlist. <b>If you 
	have an edited masterlist, using this updater will cause you to lose all your edits.</b></p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div><span>Uninstallation</span>
	<p>Delete BOSS.exe, "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" and, if BOSS has been run, the BOSS folder in your ..\Oblivion\Data folder.</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div><span>Further Details</span>
	<p>BOSS has a few command-line switches. The syntax is:</p>
	<div>
	<p><code>BOSS [--update | -u] [--help | -h] [--disable-version-parse | -V-] [--revert-level | -r] [level]</code></p>
	<p><code>-h, --help</code>:</p>
	<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line switches.</p>
	<p><code>-u, --update</code>:</p>
	<p>If this switch is used, BOSS will automatically update the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sort your mods. Since this replaces your current 
	masterlist, don't run this if you have an edited copy and wish to keep the changes. The "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" runs BOSS with this switch.</p>
	<p><code>-V-, --disable-version-parse</code>:</p>
	<p>Disables the parsing of each mod's description to extract the author's version information, so it is not printed alongside other data in the generated BOSSlog.html. This can be used if the version 
	parsing is not working properly for some of your mods, and you wish to remove the version notes.</p>
	<p><code>-r, --revert-level</code>:</p>
	<p>Sets BOSS to undo its changes by reverting back the number of levels given by <code>level</code> to the load order at that point. <code>level</code> can take values of 1 or 2. A value of 1 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
	A value of 2 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.</p>
	</div><br />
	<p>The only changes BOSS makes to your Oblivion install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, to create a BOSS folder there, and create a few text files in that BOSS folder. Oblivion.esm 
	is never touched, and all dates are derived from it.</p>
	<div>The text files that are used and created by BOSS are all found in the ..\Oblivion\Data\BOSS folder, and they are:
	<ul>
		<li><i>masterlist.txt</i> - This is the master list of mods that BOSS recognises, listing them in order and which includes notes attached to them. It is the most frequently updated component of BOSS, receiving updates almost every day.</li>
		<li><i>BOSSlog.html</i> - This log is where the output that BOSS generates and displays once the program ends is stored. It is replaced every time you run BOSS. You can view it in any web browser.</li>
		<li><i>modlist.txt</i> - This file contains the list of your mods in the order they were before you last ran BOSS, which can be used as a undo changes to your load order.</li>
		<li><i>modlist.old</i> - This file contains the contents of your modlist.txt before you last ran BOSS, providing a second level of undo for load order changes.</li>
	</ul>
	</div><br />
	<div><p>To undo the changes BOSS makes to your load order, you can use the included "BOSS - Undo Last Run.bat" file.
	The .bat file will, by default, revert to the load order before the last run of BOSS, as stored in modlist.txt. If you want to revert back to the load order before that, as stored in modlist.old, you will need to edit your "BOSS - Undo Last Run.bat"
	file:
	<ol>
		<li>Right-click it and select "Edit" to open it up in Notepad.</li>
		<li>On the line containing "<code>BOSS.exe -r 1</code>", replace the 1 with a 2 to give "<code>BOSS.exe -r 2</code>".</li>
		<li>Then save the file and run it to revert your load order back two levels.</li>
	</p></div><br />
	<p>One of the best ways more experienced users can use BOSS is to edit your own copy of masterlist.txt and include there any mods not listed. You can "merge" in new updates 
	(provided you don't use the built-in updater, but download the update manually) with the excellent free open-source <a href="http://www.winmerge.org">WinMerge</a> software.</p>
	<p>An alternative is to use the <a href="http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=29790">BOSS Master List Manager (BOMM)</a> by surazel, which is a Word 2003, 2007 and 2010 Macro that provides many useful features including powerful masterlist editing options.</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div><span>Contributions and Help</span>
	<p>General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised mods, takes place in the Bethesda Softworks Oblivion Mods forum's <a href="http://www.bethsoft.com/bgsforums/index.php?showtopic=995808">official BOSS thread</a>.</p>
	<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.</p>
	<p>Lists of unrecognised mods are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).</li>
		<li>A link to where the description, mod or readme can be found to read or download.</li>
		<li>A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.</li>
	</ul>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div><span>Updates</span>
	<p>Updates are published from <a href="http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516">TES Nexus</a>.</p>
	<p>The latest masterlist is always on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/">Google Code repository</a>.</p>
	<p>Files on Nexus are updated once a week or so. Always use the latest dated files.</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div><span>Additional Files</span>
	<p>FCOM-only masterlist.txt database file. Using it instead of the normal one will move all FCOM files to the start in the correct order (and check for problems, show comments as usual) but leave all other mods' 
	load order the same as before running BOSS. Useful for troubleshooting purposes and useful to anyone who wants to keep their existing mod load order then add FCOM and finalise everything by hand. This file is getting 
	very old but it does the job (sort of).</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div><span>Troubleshooting</span>
	<p>Under some circumstances, BOSS may not be able to run properly due to a variety of reasons. In such cases, BOSS should be able to provide an error message detailing the typle of fault. If the program unexpectedly crashes, the crash and the circumstances in which it occurred should be reported to the official BOSS thread (linked to in the <em>Quick Links</em> section below), so that we may fix it.
	Here is a list of the error messages and their common causes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: Sub-directory "Data\BOSS\" could not be created!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the Data folder.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that your Data folder is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />	
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: <em>filename</em> could not be written to!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the BOSS folder, or the given file if it exists.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that your BOSS folder (and the file, if it exists) is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />	
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: Master .ESM file not found!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS is not being run in the correct folder.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Move BOSS into your Data folder.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />	
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: Master .ESM file cannot be read!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> This error should never occur. If you see it, please report it to the BOSS team as soon as possible.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> If this error is displayed, it means that your master .ESM file exists, but its date cannot be read. This can only take place under very specialised circumstances, such as corruption of your master .ESM file, and probably means you will have to seek expert help.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Error: Masterlist update failed.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> No Internet connection.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Double-check that your Internet connection is working, and try again.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Your masterlist.txt cannot be written to.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that your BOSS folder (and masterlist.txt if it exists) is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> The masterlist is not available at Google Code.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Check the official forum thread for any information as to why the masterlist is not available. You can also check the Google Code repository to see if Google has posted any messages about maintenance that might result in the repository being unavailable.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: <em>filename</em> cannot be read!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Your masterlist.txt does not exist, or is in the wrong place.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that your masterlist.txt is in your Data\BOSS folder, or use the masterlist updater to download a new masterlist to the correct place.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Error: Could not change the date of "<em>filename</em>", make sure you have write access to it.</spa<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the plugin given.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Check that the plugin is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>In addition to the specific error messages above, BOSS may also fail to work properly, or appear to do so, for a few general reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS won't run.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Using BOSS version under 1.6.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Update to version 1.6.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> No change in load order.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Wrye Bash's "Lock Times" load order locking feature is enabled.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Disable "Lock Times" before running BOSS.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> When BOSS is run, a "<code>File not found - *.ghost</code>" message is displayed in the console window.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS cannot find any ghosted mods.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> This is normal BOSS behaviour, and does not indicate anything being wrong with it or your mods. It is displayed when BOSS tries to remove the read-only attribute of any mods ghosted by Wrye Bash, but cannot find any. Therefore, if you are not ghosting any mods, BOSS will display the message.</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Install Oblivion outside the Program Files (or Program Files (x86) folder if on 64 bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing Oblivion outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.</li>
		<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.</li>
		<li>Give yourself Full Control permissions over your Oblivion install. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall Oblivion to a new location. For BOSS to run unhindered, only Full Control over the Data folder is required, though if using other modding programs such as Wrye Bash or Oblivion Mod Manager, you may find it more useful to give yourself Full Control over your Bethesda Softworks folder.</li>
		<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the BOSS.exe, and select "Run as administrator".</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves Full Control permissions, here is a guide:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select "Properties".</li>
		<li>In Properties, select the "Security" tab, and click the "Edit..." button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.</li>
		<li>In the "Group or user names" box, select the "Users" option.</li>
		<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite "Full Control" in the "Allow" column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.</li>
		<li>In the Properties window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.</li>
	</ol>
