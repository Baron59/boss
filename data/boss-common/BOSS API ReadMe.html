<div id="intro"><h1>Introduction</h1>
<p>This documentation details the BOSS API and is intended for use by third party developers of modding utilities for TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Nehrim - At Fate's Edge, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas.

<p>The BOSS API has a C frontend and is available as a 32-bit DLL that can be loaded by other modding utilities so that they can easily take advantage of the information stored within BOSS's files without having to write their own interfaces and keep such interfaces up-to-date as BOSS evolves.

<p>Developers can request additional functionality and report any bugs encountered in the offical BOSS API thread currently found <a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/index.php?/topic/1221990-wip-bapi-boss-api/">here</a>.
</div>

<div id="overview"><h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The BOSS API allows third parties to extract information from BOSS's masterlist and userlist using the same parsers that BOSS itself uses, thereby minimising the effort required and increasing compatibility. The API currently has the following capabilities:
<ul>
	<li>Extract Bash Tag addition and removal suggestions for mods from the masterlist and userlist.
	<li>Extract dirty mod messages from the masterlist and determine cleanliness of mods.
	<li>Write a minimal masterlist containing only mods with Bash Tag suggestions, and those suggestions.
</ul>
<p>The API can also handle determining compatibility with other versions of BOSS that may be present. The API currently has a few shortcomings over a general file read, owing to the fact that it parses the lists in the same manner that BOSS itself does:
<ul>
	<li>Conditional information is only accessible if the condition	is fulfilled. This means that when the user's installed mod list changes, the database will have to be reloaded.
	<li>Database loading is very slow.
</ul>
<p>These shortcomings will be addressed in updates to the API, either in pre-release or in future releases.
<p>Below is a short overview of BOSS's masterlist, userlist and their capabilities for those unfamiliar with them:
<p>The masterlist is the file which holds the load order of all BOSS's recognised plugins. There is a separate masterlist for each game that BOSS supports, but since it only ever works on one game at a time, only one masterlist is generally ever referred to at any one time. The masterlist also holds messages to attach to plugins that BOSS displays in its BOSS Log output file, and these messages include general notes, Bash Tag suggestions (for addition and/or removal), requirements, incompatibilities, information regarding dirty edits, warnings and errors.
<p>The userlist is a file that BOSS users can use to override or add to BOSS's sorting and message display functionality using a specific rule syntax. The capabilities of these rules include overriding BOSS's ordering of individual plugins or groups of plugins, having BOSS sort plugins it would otherwise not recognise (ie. that are not in its masterlist) and adding or overriding plugin messages.
</div>

<div id="types"><h1>Variable Types</h1>
<p>The API uses character strings and integers for information input/output. 
<ul>
	<li>All API strings are unsigned 8-bit character strings (uint8_t*) encoded in UTF-8.
	<li>All API numbers and return codes are unsigned 32-bit integers (uint32_t).
</ul>
<p>The API also introduces two new structures:
<p><code>typedef struct _boss_db_int * boss_db;</code>
<p>Abstracts the definition of BOSS's internal state while still providing type safety across the API.

<p><pre><code>typedef struct {
    uint32_t id;
    const uint8_t * name;
} BashTag;</code></pre>
<p>The BashTag structure gives the Unique Identifier (UID) for each Bash Tag and the corresponding Bash Tag name.
</div>

<div id="codes"><h1>Return Codes</h1>
<p>The BOSS API functions uses the following uint32_t return codes to signal how a function completes.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Return Code<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_OK<td>The function completed successfully.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_FILE_WRITE_FAIL<td>A file could not be written to.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_FILE_NOT_UTF8<td>The specified BOSS file (masterlist or userlist) is not encoded in UTF-8.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_FILE_NOT_FOUND<td>The specified file could not be found.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_PARSE_FAIL<td>There was an error parsing the file.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_NO_MEM<td>The API was unable to allocate the required memory.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_OVERWRITE_FAIL<td>The API was unable to overwrite the minimal masterlist specified.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_INVALID_ARGS<td>Invalid arguments were given for the function.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_ERROR_MAX<td>Matches the value of the highest-numbered return code (BOSS_API_ERROR_INVALID_ARGS). It isn't returned by any functions.
</table>
</div>



<div id="functions"><h1>Functions</h1>
<p>BOSS API provides the functions listed below to clients. Where a function returns a uint32_t value, this is the function's return code.

<h2 id="functions-version">Version Functions</h2>

<p><code>bool <span style="color:blue;">IsCompatibleVersion</span> (uint32_t bossVersionMajor, uint32_t bossVersionMinor, uint32_t bossVersionPatch);</code>
<p>Returns whether this version of BOSS supports the API from the given BOSS version. Abstracts BOSS API stability policy away from clients.

<p><code>uint32_t <span style="color:blue;">GetVersionString</span> (const uint8_t ** bossVersionStr);</code>
<p>Returns the version string for this version of BOSS. The string exists for the lifetime of the library.

<h2 id="functions-lifecycle">Lifecycle Management Functions</h2>
<p><code>uint32_t <span style="color:blue;">CreateBossDb</span>  (boss_db * db);</code>
<p><code>void <span style="color:blue;">DestroyBossDb</span> (boss_db db);</code>
<p>Explicitly manage database lifetime. Allows clients to free memory when they want/need to.

<h2 id="functions-loading">Database Loading Functions</h2>

<p><code>uint32_t <span style="color:blue;">Load</span> (boss_db db, const uint8_t * masterlistPath, const uint8_t * userlistPath, const uint8_t * dataPath);</code>
<p>Loads the masterlist and userlist from the paths specified. Can be called multiple times. If an error is encountered, the database remains unchanged. Paths are case-sensitive if the underlying filesystem is case-sensitive. masterlistPath and userlistPath are files. dataPath is a directory. If userlistPath is an empty string, then the userlist is not loaded.

<p><code>uint32_t <span style="color:blue;">ReEvalRegex</span> (boss_db db, const uint8_t * dataPath);</code>
<p>Re-evaluates the masterlist's regex entries, so Load() doesn't need to be called whenever the mods installed are changed. This doesn't need to be used if Load() is called, as the evaluation is incorporated into Load() too. Paths are case-sensitive if the underlying filesystem is case-sensitive.


<h2 id="functions-access">Database Access Functions</h2>
<p><code>uint32_t <span style="color:blue;">GetBashTagMap</span> (boss_db db, BashTag ** tagMap, uint32_t * numTags);</code>
<p>Returns an array of the Bash Tags encounterred when loading the masterlist and userlist, and the number of tags in the returned array. The array and its contents are static and valid until the db is destroyed or until the Load() function is called. It should not be freed by the client.

<p><code>uint32_t <span style="color:blue;">GetModBashTags</span> (boss_db db, const uint8_t * modName, uint32_t ** tagIds_added, uint32_t * numTags_added, uint32_t **tagIds_removed, uint32_t *numTags_removed, bool * userlistModified);</code>
<p>Returns arrays of Bash Tag UIDs for Bash Tags suggested for addition and removal by BOSS's masterlist and userlist, and the number of tags in each array. The returned arrays are valid until GetModBashTags() is called again, the db is destroyed or the Load() function is called.  The arrays should not be freed by the client. modName is case-insensitive. If no Tags are found for an array, the array pointer (*tagIds) will be NULL. The userlistModified bool is true if the userlist contains Bash Tag suggestion message additions.



<p><code>uint32_t <span style="color:blue;">GetDirtyMessage</span> (boss_db db, const uint8_t * modName, const uint8_t ** message, uint32_t * needsCleaning);</code>
<p>Returns the message associated with a dirty mod and whether the mod needs cleaning. If a mod has no dirty message, *message will be NULL. modName is case-insensitive. The return values for needsCleaning are:
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>needsCleaning Value<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_CLEAN_NO<td>The plugin does not need cleaning or should not be cleaned.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_CLEAN_YES<td>The plugin needs cleaning.
		<tr><td>BOSS_API_CLEAN_UNKNOWN<td>BOSS does not know whether the plugin needs cleaning or not, or if it should not be cleaned.
</table>
<p>The message string is valid until GetDirtyMessage() is called again, the db is destroyed or the Load() function is called. The string should not be freed by the client.

<p><code>uint32_t <span style="color:blue;">DumpMinimal</span> (boss_db db, const uint8_t * outputFile, const bool overwrite);</code>
<p>Writes a minimal masterlist that only contains mods that have Bash Tag suggestions, plus the Tag suggestions themselves, in order to create the Wrye Bash taglist. outputFile is the path to use for output. If outputFile already exists, it will only be overwritten if overwrite is true.

<div id="contact"><h1>Contact</h1>
<p>The BOSS development team can be contacted by Private Messaging any of the handles given in the <q>Project Members</q> section of the main BOSS readme at the noted forums. However, for API-specific support, it is best to contact WrinklyNinja (available on the Bethesda Softworks forums and The Nexus Forums), who is currently responsible for all BOSS code development, including the API. Other team members are unlikely to be of any great assistance with coding-related queries.
