<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>BOSS helps mod users avoid serious conflicts by setting the mod plugins they have installed in their optimal load order. BOSS recognises over 22,100 plugins across the 6 games it supports, with the breakdown being roughly:
<ul>
	<li>13,300+ TES IV: Oblivion plugins.
	<li>3,500+ TES V: Skyrim plugins.
	<li>3,100+ Fallout 3 plugins.
	<li>3,100+ Fallout: New Vegas plugins.
	<li>180+ Nehrim - At Fate's Edge plugins.
</ul>
<p>To set the proper load order for mod plugins that BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of load ordering is still necessary. See <a href="#appendix-e">Introduction To Load Orders</a> for an overview.
<p><strong>Although BOSS technically supports TES III: Morrowind, no mod plugins are recognised and no further support is planned.</strong> Morrowind users looking for an automated load order manager should consider using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mlox/">mlox</a> instead.
<p>BOSS sorts plugins ghosted by the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities, and provides Bash Tag suggestions. It also provides over 10,000 plugin-specific messages, including usage notes, requirements, incompatibilities, warnings on bugs and installation mistake notifications. The positioning of plugins and the messages BOSS displays for them can be easily customised, and BOSS has a large number of options to control its features and how it displays its output.
<p>Finally, if you're developing a modding utility and find yourself dealing with load orders, the BOSS API gives access to almost all of BOSS's functionality, plus more general load order and active status management functionality that works uniformly across all supported games. See the <a href="BOSS%20API%20Readme.html">BOSS API Readme</a> for more information on that.


<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
<p><b>BOSS does not support Windows 2000 or earlier.</b>
<p>The simplest way to install BOSS is to use the installer. However, the instructions below are provided if a manual install method is preferred.
<ol>
	<li>If updating from an earlier version of BOSS, uninstall the existing BOSS install before continuing. Any userlists you have should be moved to a temporary location while you install the BOSS update.
	<li>Extract the <q>BOSS</q> folder the downloaded archive contains to a location of your choice. Make sure that you have the appropriate file permissions for the directory you choose. See the <a href="#appendix-c">File Permissions</a> section for more information. Note that if you install the BOSS folder to the same location as a supported game's executable, BOSS will only run for that game by default, and will not ask you to choose which game it should run for, even if you have other supported games installed.
	<li>If any of the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities are installed, make sure their <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> setting is enabled.
	<li>If updating from an earlier version of BOSS and you moved any userlists you have to a temporary location, after you have run BOSS at least once for each game with a userlist, you will need to move your userlist(s) into the game(s) subfolders that are created within the BOSS folder.
</ol>
<p>See the <a href="#gui">The Graphical User Interface</a> or <a href="#cli">The Command Line Interface</a> sections for information on running BOSS.


<h2 id="remove">Uninstallation</h2>
<p>If BOSS was installed using the installer, then use the uninstaller it provides a link to in the Start Menu to uninstall BOSS. If BOSS was installed manually, simply delete the <q>BOSS</q> folder you installed.


<h2 id="gui">The Graphical User Interface</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> provides a simple way to run BOSS while allowing access to its various settings and more powerful features without having to manually edit any files. It can be launched by clicking the <q>BOSS GUI</q> Start Menu link (if you installed BOSS using the installer) or by running the <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> found in the BOSS folder.
<h3 id="gui-startup">Startup</h3>
<p>When you first run the GUI, you may be presented with the following dialog.
<figure>
<img alt="select game" src="images/GUI-Select-Game.png"/>
<figcaption>The Select Game dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This dialog is displayed if you did not install the BOSS folder next to a supported game's executable and you have either not run the GUI before, or it cannot find the game that you last ran it for. Pick the game that you want to run BOSS for, and click <q>OK</q>. If you select a game marked <q>(not detected)</q> then you will only be able to download the latest masterlist for that game, and not sort any plugins.
<p>After you have selected a game and clicked <q>OK</q>, the dialog will close and you will be presented with the GUI's main window.
<h3 id="gui-main">The Main Window</h3>
<figure>
<img alt="main window" src="images/GUI-Main.png"/>
<figcaption>The BOSS GUI's main window, containing the most commonly used options.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The title bar of the main window displays which game the GUI is running for: this may also be checked by seeing which game is selected in the <q>Active Game</q> menu.
<p>The buttons and options are all fairly self-explanatory, but are detailed in the tables below. The <q>Run BOSS</q> button and <q>File&#x2192;Run BOSS</q> menu entry both do exactly the same thing, as do the <q>View BOSS Log</q> button and <q>File&#x2192;View BOSS Log</q> menu entry, and the <q>Edit User Rules</q> button and <q>Edit&#x2192;User Rules...</q> menu entry.
<p>The behaviour of the <q>Active Game</q> menu requires some explanation. The menu allows you to change which game the GUI is running for without having to close and re-open it. Games that the GUI cannot find are greyed out, and the active game, ie. the one the GUI is running for, is marked with a dot to its left. To change the active game, simply select another game in the list. Setting the run type to <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> will un-grey all the games, allowing any of them to be selected, while changing from <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> to another run type will grey out undetected games again. If an undetected game is active when you change run type, the GUI will automatically switch to the first detected game in the list.
<p>The run options on the right of the main window decide how BOSS runs. BOSS has three main modes of operation that are mutually exclusive: it can either sort your plugins, only update your masterlist then quit, or undo its changes to your load order. The options specific to each mode of operation are listed under each mode's radio button. When BOSS sorts your plugins, it will re-order the plugins it recognises to their correct positions, putting any plugins it doesn't recognise after them in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.

<h3 id="gui-urm">The User Rules Manager</h3>
<figure>
<img alt="user rules editor window" src="images/GUI-User-Rules-Manager.png"/>
<figcaption>The User Rules Manager, a graphical interface for customising how BOSS sorts your plugins and what messages it displays.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>BOSS's sorting of your plugins and the messages it displays can be customised using <em>user rules</em>. User rules can:
<ol>
	<li>Sort plugins relative to other plugins. Plugins can be <code>.esp</code> or <code>.esm</code> files, and you can both override the positions of plugins BOSS recognises and sort plugins that are unrecognised.
	<li>Sort groups of plugins relative to other groups of plugins. BOSS's masterlist generally lists plugins in thematic groups, which you can override the relative positioning of. You can't create new groups though.
	<li>Insert plugins into the top or bottom of groups of plugins.
	<li>Edit the messages BOSS attaches to plugins. You can add new messages or replace existing messages with your own.
</ol>
<p>The User Rules Manager allows easy management of your user rules without having to know any of their syntax (though if you want to customise messages, you need to know their syntax - fortunately it is pretty simple).
<h4 id="gui-urm-what">What Everything Does</h4>
<p>The <q>User Rules</q> box lists any user rules you have created. Rules are applied in the order they are listed, and their order can be changed using the <q>Move Rule Up</q> and <q>Move Rule Down</q> buttons at the bottom of the window. A rule that is greyed out and has its checkbox unchecked is disabled, and will not be applied when BOSS is run. The currently selected rule is highlighted with a grey background.
<p>If a rule was created to sort a plugin that was not listed in the masterlist, and that plugin was then added to the masterlist in an update, the User Rules Manager will automatically disable the rule when it loads, to signify that the rule is no longer required. You can then choose to re-enable the rule by checking its checkbox, or delete it, by selecting the rule and clicking the <q>Delete Rule</q> button at the bottom of the window.
<p>Clicking on a rule will load it into the <q>Rule Editor</q> box, where you can then change what it does and either overwrite the existing rule with your edits, using the <q>Save Edited Rule</q> button, or create a new rule from your edits, using the <q>Create New Rule</q> button.
<p>The <q>Installed Plugins</q> tab lists all the plugins found in the active game's Data folder, listed in load order. The <q>Masterlist</q> tab displays the masterlist contents as a tree list, showing the plugins in their groups. Double clicking on a collapsed group will expand it, showing the plugins and groups it contains, while double clicking on an expanded group will collapse it, hiding the plugins and groups it contains. Selecting a plugin will display the messages attached to it by the masterlist in the <q>Default Plugin Messages</q> box. You can search either list using the search box at the top of each tab. Searching looks for matches from the start of plugin and group names, and is performed when the <code>Enter</code> keyboard key is pressed, and may be cancelled by clicking the grey cross that appears in the search box.

<h4 id="gui-urm-how">How To Create A Rule</h4>
<ol>
	<li>Drag and drop the plugin or group you want to sort and/or edit messages for from the <q>Installed Plugins</q> or <q>Masterlist</q> tab into the <q>For</q> text box. You can also type the plugin/group name in yourself.
	<li>If you want to sort the plugin or group, check the <q>Sort Item</q> checkbox.
	<ul>
		<li>If you want to sort the plugin/group after another plugin/group, make sure the <q>Sort</q> radio button is selected and choose <q>before</q> or <q>after</q> as desired from the drop down box next to it. Drag and drop (or type in) the plugin/group you want to sort your plugin/group relative to into the text box next to the drop-down box.
		<li>If the item you're sorting is a plugin, not a group, and you want to insert the plugin into a group, make sure the <q>Insert</q> radio button is selected and choose <q>top</q> or <q>bottom</q> as desired from the drop down box next to it. Then drag and drop the group you want to insert the plugin into from the <q>Masterlist</q> tab into the text box next to the drop-down menu.
	</ul>
	<li>If the item you're creating a rule for is a plugin, and you want to edit the messages attached to it, check the <q>Add the following messages</q> checkbox.
	<ul>
		<li>Any messages you write in the text box following the checkbox will be added to the plugin in addition to those already attached by the masterlist. If you want to replace the messages attached by the masterlist with your own, also check the <q>Replace Existing Messages</q> checkbox.
		<li>Any messages you write in the text box must be written using the correct syntax, a summary of which is given in the <a href="BOSS%20Userlist%20Syntax.html#messages">BOSS Message Format</a> section of the Userlist Syntax Readme.
	</ul>
</ol>
<p>When you click either of the <q>Create New Rule</q> or <q>Save Edited Rule</q> buttons, the User Rules Manager will check that the rule has valid syntax, and warn you of any errors encountered. Invalid rules will not be saved.
<p>Once you have finished editing your user rules, use the <q>Save and Exit</q> button to save your changes to your userlist, or the <q>Cancel</q> button to exit without saving.
<p>Further information on user rules, including the details on their syntax, can be found in the <a href="#userRules">User Rules</a> section of this readme.

<h2 id="bosslog">The BOSS Log</h2>
<figure>
<img alt="boss log" style="border:1px black solid;" src="images/HTML-Log.png"/>
<figcaption>The HTML-format BOSS Log.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The BOSS Log is where you will find all of BOSS's outputted information. It can be generated in either HTML format (the default) or as a plain text file with minimal formatting. The HTML format has significant advantages over the plain text format, being considerably easier to read, containing colour-coded messages and a variety of interactive features to customise what is displayed.

<h3 id="bosslog-common">Common Features</h3>
<p>Both log formats contain the following sections:
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>BOSS Log Section<th>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Summary<td>This section gives a short summary of BOSS's actions. It breaks down the numbers of plugins installed and messages attached to them and gives the local masterlist version and whether or not it was updated. Any messages contained within the masterlist that are specific to your install but not specific to any one plugin will also be displayed here, as will any file parser and masterlist updater error messages produced.
		<tr><td>User Rules<td>This section is displayed if BOSS finds any user rules in your userlist. It details the successes or failures of the application of your user rules.
		<tr><td>Script Extender Plugins<td>This section is displayed if you have your game's Script Extender installed. It will list the Script Extender and any plugins for it that you have installed, displaying their versions (if given) and their CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled).
		<tr><td>Recognised Plugins<br /><i>or</i><br />Restored Load Order<td>This section comprises the bulk of BOSS's output, listing all your recognised installed plugins and any messages BOSS has attached to them, as well as version information (if given) and the plugin CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled). If you are running BOSS to undo its changes, this section is titled <q>Restored Load Order</q>, and lists the restored load order.
		<tr><td>Unrecognised Plugins<td>This section is displayed if you have plugins installed that are unrecognised by BOSS, and lists them. These plugins should be submitted to the BOSS team so they can be added to the relevant masterlist. See the <a href="#help">Contributions &amp; Help</a> section for further information.
</table>
<p>BOSS will display the version numbers of any plugins that provide them in their description fields. If a plugin supplies no version number, it cannot be displayed. The version numbers may not reflect the actual version of the mod installed - this could either be due to the mod author forgetting to update the description, or due to a mistake in BOSS's detection. As version numbers are supplied by mod authors in a wide range of formats and BOSS has to detect as many as possible, it occasionally identifies parts of some descriptions as version numbers incorrectly. When in doubt, check the version number given in a mod's readme. 
<p>It should be noted that the vast majority of BOSS's mod messages are non-conditional, in that they are not displayed in response to your specific install. For example, a message that gives some of the mod's incompatibilities does not know if you have them installed or not, and a message telling you to do something will not know if it has been done.
<p>BOSS's mod messages are one of the most important features BOSS provides, acting as a means of providing users with information that they might otherwise not obtain. It is important for a stable, healthy game that you act on any messages that require action. If you think a message suggests an action that is not necessary, report it to an official BOSS thread. While the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities will automatically import and apply Bash Tag suggestions from BOSS, some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention, so read the suggestions made thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> if necessary.
<p>Unrecognised mods must be re-ordered by hand using a mod manager such as <abbr title="Nexus Mod Manager">NMM</abbr>/<abbr title="Oblivion Mod Manager">OBMM</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Mod Manager">FOMM</abbr> or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>, or using BOSS's <a href="#userRules">user rules</a> functionality.

<h3 id="bosslog-html">HTML-Only Features</h3>

<p>While the plain text BOSS Log simply lists the sections detailed above and their contents, the HTML BOSS Log functions more like an extension of the BOSS program, and uses a much richer interface. It requires a minimum of Internet Explorer 9, Firefox 3.5, Chrome 4, Safari 4, Opera 10.5 or any equivalent browser to function and display correctly, though some of the features have additional requirements with varying levels of browser support. When the BOSS Log is opened, it will display a <q>Browser Compatibility</q> panel detailing which of these features the browser being used supports, and which it does not, with unsupported features being automatically disabled.
<p>The HTML BOSS Log's additional features are:
<h4 id="bosslog-html-filters">Filters</h4>
<p>The BOSS Log's filters can be used to selectively hide different types of information in the BOSS Log from view, making it easier to see what you're looking for. The filters are found in a floating panel at the bottom of the window that can have its visibility toggled by clicking on the <q>Filters</q> button in the sidebar. Filters are turned on and off via their checkboxes, and the numbers of hidden plugins and messages are given below the filter checkboxes. If a filter doesn't apply to the currently-displayed BOSS Log section, its checkbox is disabled. The filters available are:
<table>
	<thead><tr><th>BOSS Log Filter<th>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Hide Version Numbers<td>Hides the version numbers printed in blue next to those plugins that provide them.

<h4 id="bosslog-html-submit">In-Log Unrecognised Plugin Submission</h4>
<p>The submission of unrecognised plugins by users is vital to the upkeep of BOSS. The HTML BOSS Log allows you to submit such plugins without having to register for an account on the official Bethesda Softworks forums and post in one of BOSS's official threads, instead anonymously sending the plugin filename together with a link to the plugin's download location and/or a description of the plugin to the BOSS Development Team's unrecognised plugin tracker, so that it can then be added to the masterlist. 
<p>The Submit Plugin interface is displayed by clicking on a plugin in the <q>Unrecognised Plugins</q> section of the BOSS Log, but only if your browser supports the feature. If unrecognised plugins are not displayed with a dotted underline which becomes a solid underline when you hover over them with your mouse, then your browser does not support this feature.
<h4 id="bosslog-html-css">CSS Settings</h4>
<p>The CSS Settings panel is displayed by clicking on the <q>CSS Settings</q> button in the sidebar. In it, you can choose to use the BOSS Log's alternative colour scheme, which is more suitable for reading in low light levels and reduces eye strain, by checking the <q>Use Alternative Colour Scheme</q> checkbox at the bottom of the panel.
<p>You can customise the colours that are used by the alternative colour scheme for each of the elements listed. If your browser supports the colour picker input type, then the elements in the <q>Colours</q> columns are displayed as colour pickers that allow you to visually select a colour. If your browser does not support the colour picker input type, the elements in the <q>Colours</q> columns will be displayed as text boxes. If your browser supports placeholders, then the defaults for each element will be displayed as placeholders. Colours must be specified using their lowercase hexadecimal codes. If your browser supports form validation, your custom colours will not be applied unless they have been specified properly.
<p>You can also back up and restore your custom colours in this panel, provided your browser supports the feaure. The colours currently given in the inputs can be backed up by clicking on the underlined <u>back up</u> text button in the paragraph following the inputs. Clicking this button will cause the BOSS Log to generate a file that contains your settings and make it available for your browser to download, at which point your browser's default behaviour for downloading files takes over. Note that your browser will most likely give the settings file a nonsensical name, but you can rename the file to whatever you want, including changing its extension, without breaking anything. You can then restore colour settings from a settings file by dragging and dropping the file into the CSS Settings panel: the panel will change colour when you hover over it to tell you that you can drop the file in it. When the file is dropped into the CSS Settings panel, its settings will be applied.
<p>Note that to apply any changes you make in the CSS Settings panel, you must click the <q>Apply</q> button. If you leave the CSS Settings panel without clicking the <q>Apply</q> button, then your changes will be discarded.
<h4 id="bosslog-html-settings">Settings Memory</h4>
<p>The Settings Memory feature allows the BOSS Log to remember the following settings when you close it, and re-apply them when you next open it:
<ul>
	<li>Which filters you have applied.
	<li>Whether or not you are using the alternative colour scheme.
	<li>What your custom alernative colour scheme colours are.
	<li>Whether or not you want to stop the Browser Compatibility panel from being displayed.
</ul>
<p>The settings stored are unique to each BOSS Log, so if you run BOSS for two different games, each BOSS Log's settings will be stored separately. Also, the settings are stored in your browser's cache, so if you clear your browsing data, the settings will be lost, hence why there is a custom colours backup/restore feature available.


<h2 id="help">Contributions &amp; Help</h2>
<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.
<p>General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised or unclean plugins, takes place in BOSS's official threads for 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1195328">Oblivion</a>, 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1132338">Nehrim</a>, 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1256118">Skyrim</a>,
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1175276">Fallout 3</a> and 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1313081">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.
<p>If your browser supports it, you can also submit unrecognised plugins directly from the HTML-format BOSS Log. This avoids the need for users to register for a new forum account if they do not already possess an account on Bethesda's forums. However, only unrecognised plugins can be submitted this way at this time.
<p>Lists of unrecognised plugins are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>A link to where the description, mod or readme can be found to read or download.
	<li>A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.
</ul>
<p>Lists of dirty plugins are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The CRC(s) of the dirty ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the dirty files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the <q>CRC checksum for data</q> is the one required.
</ul>

<h2 id="cli">The Command Line Interface</h2>
<p>BOSS's <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> can be run from the command line, or launched by clicking the <q>BOSS</q> Start Menu link (if you installed BOSS using the installer) or by running the <q>BOSS.exe</q> found in the BOSS folder.
<p>The CLI possesses no means of changing any settings while it is running. Its settings can instead be altered by adjusting the values of settings in the BOSS.ini configuration file, and by supplying command line arguments when launching the CLI.
<figure>
<img src="images/CLI.png" alt="boss cli"/>
<figcaption>BOSS's CLI in action.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Like the GUI, when the CLI is run it will first look for any supported games. If BOSS is not installed next to a supported game's executable, and more than one supported game is found, then it will present the user with a dialog in the command line window asking the user to select a game to run for, as seen above. Unlike the GUI, it will not offer to run for games that are not detected.
<p>Once a game has been selected (if applicable), the CLI's execution is almost identical to what the GUI does when its <q>Run BOSS</q> button is pressed.

<h3 id="cli-cla">Command Line Arguments</h3>
<p>While the BOSS GUI allows you to specify options using its graphical elements, the CLI uses a combination of the BOSS.ini file and command line arguments to do the same. The syntax for these arguments is:
<code class="box">boss [-hVuosdctUl] [-g [game]] [-r [level]] [-v [level]] [-f [type]] [-H [hostname]] [-P [port]]</code>
<code class="box">-h [ --help ]</code>
<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments, then exits.
<code class="box">-V [ --version ]</code>
<p>Prints the a banner displaying the program name and version number to the command line, then exits.
<code class="box">-u [ --update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sorts your plugins. This behaviour is enabled by default, so the command line parameter will have no effect except when the automatic masterlist updating has been disabled in the ini.
<code class="box">-U [ --no-update ]</code>
<p>Inhibits the default automatic masterlist updater, preventing it from running. Must not be used alongside --update,-u.
<code class="box">-o [ --only-update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then does <b>not</b> sort your plugins.
<code class="box">-g [ --game ] [ game ]</code>
<p>Overrides game autodetection. The valid values of the argument are: <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code>, <code>FalloutNV</code>, <code>Skyrim</code> and <code>Morrowind</code>. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS falls back to autodetection, unless <code>-o</code> is also passed, in which case BOSS will run successfully whether or not the game is installed.
<code class="box">-s [ --silent ]</code>
<p>Stops BOSS from automatically opening up the BOSS Log in your web browser (or text editor, depending on format chosen) after it has finished running.
<code class="box">-c [ --crc-display ]</code>
<p>Calculates the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, including <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Skyrim Script Extender">SKSE</abbr> plugins, and displays them in your BOSS Log alongside the plugin names.
<code class="box">-f [ --format ] [ type ]</code>
<p>Allows the selection of the BOSS Log format. Valid argument values are: <code>html</code> and <code>text</code>. <code>html</code> is the default output format. The <code>text</code> value will print the BOSS Log as plain text into a 'BOSSlog.txt' file, similar to the BOSS Log in BOSS v1.5 and below.
<code class="box">-t [ --trial-run ]</code>
<p>BOSS runs, but no plugins are redated, so your load order is not changed. The BOSS Log still displays the order BOSS would have placed them in, so it is useful for checking what would happen if you ran BOSS on your load order without having to then undo BOSS's changes.
<code class="box">-r [ --revert ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Revert to a previous load order. This parameter optionally accepts values of <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>, indicating how many undo steps to apply. If no option is specified, it defaults to <code>1</code>. A value of <code>1</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
A value of <code>2</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.
<code class="box">-v [ --verbose ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Specify the verbosity level (<code>0</code> to <code>3</code>) of the debugging output. <code>0</code> is the default, showing only warning and error messages. <code>1</code> (warning, error and informational messages) is implied if this option is specified without an argument. Higher values increase the verbosity further.
<code class="box">-d [ --debug-with-source ]</code>
<p>Adds source file references (filenames and line numbers) to debugging statements.
<code class="box">-l [ log-debug ]</code>
<p>Logs the debug output to the <q>BOSSDebugLog.txt</q> file instead of the command line.
<code class="box">-H [ --proxy-host ] [ hostname ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy hostname for the masterlist updater. The hostname may be an actual hostname (eg. <code>proxy.company.com</code>), an IP address (eg. <code>192.168.32.4</code>) or <code>none</code>. <code>none</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.
<code class="box">-P [ --proxy-port ] [ port ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy port number for the masterlist updater. The port number may be any valid port number. <code>0</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.

<h3 id="cli-ini">The BOSS.ini</h3>
<figure>
<img alt="userlist" src="images/Ini.png"/>
<figcaption>An example BOSS.ini, as viewed in Notepad. In this BOSS.ini, the BOSS Log format has been set to plain text.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Users can edit all of BOSS's settings in the BOSS.ini. This is where BOSS gets its settings from when launching the CLI and the GUI. If BOSS is run and it cannot find a BOSS.ini, it will generate a new one with default settings. If the CLI is run with both a BOSS.ini present and command line parameters set, the command line parameters override the settings in BOSS.ini. The ini is split into the following sections:
<h4 id="cli-ini-general">General Settings</h4>
<p>These settings control miscellaneous areas of BOSS's operation outside of the main sorting functionality.
<table>

<h2 id="updates">Keeping BOSS Up To Date</h2>
<p>It is important that you keep your BOSS installation updated, not only to benefit from the many frequent updates made to the masterlists, but also to benefit from bug fixes, improvements and new features introduced to new releases of BOSS itself.
<p>Providing there is an Internet connection available when BOSS runs, it will automatically download and apply any updates available for the masterlist of the game it is running for by default. BOSS will also check for new releases and if an update is available it will notify the user, displaying release notes if any are available. Additionally, if you installed BOSS using the automated installer, BOSS will ask the user if they wish to update, and automatically download and run the updated version's installer if so. The check for new releases functionality behaves as outlined below:
<ol>
 <li>On launching, it automatically checks for updates to BOSS. If an update is found, it proceeds to the next step. If no update is available, or no Internet connection is present, it will display no message.
 <ul>
  <li>If you run the <q>Check For Updates</q> option from the GUI's Help option, then it will display messages detailing if no update was found or if there were any errors.
 </ul>
 <li>No matter how the update check was started, if an update is available it will notify the user, asking whether or not to download and install the update if BOSS was installed using the automated installer. If the user decides not to update, the updater will quit.
 <li>If the user decides to update, then it will begin downloading the new installer to the BOSS folder, displaying the progress. If using the GUI, the download can be cancelled at any time, in which case any downloaded file will be deleted and the updater will quit. CLI users can cancel the download by quitting BOSS, but no cleanup will take place.
</ol>
<p>Under certain circumstances the masterlist and program updaters may be unable to function correctly. If the computer the user has BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet, the following instructions should be followed to obtain masterlist updates:
<ol>
	<li>Copy <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> from your BOSS folder to a computer with an Internet connection.
	<li>Run <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> and choose the appropriate game when prompted.
	<li>Make sure that the GUI is set to the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> run option.
	<li>If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, also record your proxy settings in the relevant part of the GUI's <q>Settings</q> window.
	<li>Select <q>Run BOSS</q>. The masterlist will be downloaded into a subfolder, named after the game you selected, in the same location as your <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>. Some other BOSS files will also be created, you can safely delete these.
</ol>
<p>A rarer circumstance is when the user connects to the Internet using a proxy. This is most common in enterprise environments, and such users will generally know if they use a proxy. If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you must either record your proxy settings in the relevant part of the GUI's <q>Settings</q> window or manually enter your proxy settings into your <q>BOSS.ini</q> settings file. See <a href="#gui-settings">The Settings Window</a> or <a href="#cli-ini">The BOSS.ini</a> for information on the expected setting values.
<p>There may also be other special cases which cause problems for BOSS's updaters that the BOSS team is unaware of. If you are having issues using the updaters, contact the BOSS team for support.
<p>BOSS program updates are also published at the
<a href="http://tes.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516">TES Nexus</a>, 
<a href="http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6">Skyrim Nexus</a>,
<a href="http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193">Fallout 3 Nexus</a> and 
<a href="http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999">New Vegas Nexus</a> BOSS pages. For those not using the masterlist updater, the latest masterlist is always on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/">Google Code repository</a>.
<p>Always make sure to use the latest version of BOSS and the latest masterlist.


<h2 id="files">BOSS Changes and Files</h2>
<p>When running for Skyrim v1.4.26+, the only change BOSS makes to your game install is to re-order the contents of its <q>plugins.txt</q> file, found in the user's local application data folder. When running for any of the other supported games, the only change BOSS makes to your game install is to re-date the <code>.esp</code> and <code>.esm</code> files in your game's Data folder.
<p>If running for Skyrim v1.4.26+, BOSS creates or edits a <q>loadorder.txt</q> file, found in the user's local application data folder. This file forms part of the community's textfile-based load ordering standard, developed for Skyrim to allow the continued sorting of inactive plugins. As it is intended to be shared between modding utilities, it is not removed when BOSS is uninstalled.
<p>If you install BOSS using the automated installer, the installer creates a few Registry entries. These entries are removed when BOSS is uninstalled using its uninstaller.
<p>BOSS stores all its files in the BOSS folder. These are:
<ul>
	<li><code>API</code> - This folder contains the BOSS API DLLs, which can be used by other utilities.
	<li><code>Docs</code> - This folder contains BOSS's documentation and the images it uses. <q>BOSS Readme.html</q> is this readme file, <q>BOSS API Readme.html</q> is the BOSS API readme, and <q>BOSS Masterlist Syntax.html</q> is developer documentation detailing the formats and syntaxes used by the masterlists. <q>Licenses.txt</q> contains copies of the copyright licenses that BOSS is distributed under.
	<li><code>BOSS.exe</code> - This is BOSS's <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> executable.
	<li><code>BOSS GUI.exe</code> - This is BOSS's <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> executable.
	<li><code>BOSSDebugLog.txt</code> - The log file for BOSS's debugging output. You can view it in any text editor.
	<li><code>BOSS.ini</code>Stores BOSS's settings, including the default run options.
	<li><code>BOSS.ini.old</code> - A backup of your previous BOSS.ini, created when you update BOSS via the installer or the GUI's auto-updater.
	<li><code>Morrowind</code>, <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Skyrim</code>, <code>Fallout 3</code> or <code>Fallout New Vegas</code> - These folders hold your game-specific BOSS files, which are:
	<ul>
		<li><code>BOSSlog.html</code> - The log generated by BOSS that is displayed when BOSS runs. It is replaced every time you run BOSS. You can view it in any web browser. Each game BOSS runs for has a separate file.
		<li><code>BOSSlog.txt</code> - The plain text version of the log, without HTML formatting. It is only created if you specify the plain text format when running BOSS. You can view it in any text editor. Each game BOSS runs for has a separate file.
		<li><code>masterlist.txt</code> - The list of plugins that BOSS recognises, listing them in order and including the notes that are displayed in the BOSS Log. It is the most frequently updated component of BOSS, receiving updates almost every day. Each game BOSS runs for has a separate file.
		<li><code>modlist.txt</code> - Contains the list of your plugins in the order they were before you last ran BOSS, which can be used to undo changes to your load order. Each game BOSS runs for has a separate file.
		<li><code>modlist.old</code> - Contains the contents of your modlist.txt before you last ran BOSS, providing a second level of undo for load order changes. Each game BOSS runs for has a separate file.
		<li><code>userlist.txt</code> - Contains your custom rules to be implemented by the User Rules feature. Each game BOSS runs for has a separate file.
	</ul>
</ul>


<h2 id="trouble">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Although BOSS is simple to use, it has grown to become a relatively complex application. As such, there are some circumstances under which BOSS may not be able to run correctly, due to a variety of possible reasons. In such cases, an error message detailing the problem should be provided. If the program unexpectedly crashes, or you experience 
a problem for which no error message is given, please report the crash or problem to an official BOSS thread (linked to in the <a href="#links">Quick Links</a> section below), so that we may fix it.
<p>If the information below does not help you to solve any problems you are experiencing, please seek further support in one of the official BOSS threads.
<h3 id="trouble-general">General Problems</h3>
<p>There are a few general reasons why BOSS may fail to function correctly. Check if any of the symptoms listed below fit your issue.
<dl>
	<dt>No change in load order.
		<dd>If you use <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>, make sure its <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> setting is enabled.
		<dd>If you're running BOSS for Skyrim, make sure that you're checking your load order using a utility that's compatible with the textfile-based load order system.
	<dt>Some plugins have the wrong or no version number given in the BOSS Log.
		<dd>No solution.
	<dt>You get an error message of the form <q>There is a problem sending the command to the program.</q>
		<dd>Windows sometimes does this when it tries to open files in their default application. If you're sure that you have a default program for HTML files set, restarting your computer generally fixes the issue.
	<dt>Skyrim is installed, but BOSS cannot detect it.
		<dd>Skyrim's Registry entry is missing. This happens to a lot of people, for some unknown reason. Run Skyrim's launcher to add the Registry entry back again.
	<dt>Your browser supports the <q>Settings Memory</q> functionality of the HTML BOSS Log, but all your settings have been lost.
		<dd>You've emptied your browser's cache, which is where the BOSS Log's settings are stored. If you've lost custom CSS settings, back them up in future. The other things remembered by the BOSS Log can be set back up how you like them in seconds.
</dl>

<h3 id="trouble-errors">Error Messages</h3>
<p>If BOSS can detect a specific reason for being unable to function correctly, it will print an error message detailing the problem. BOSS's error messages are listed below, along with details of the issues and possible solutions.

<dl>
	<dt>No game detected!
		<dd>If it is Skyrim that cannot be detected, run Skyrim's launcher to add the Registry entry back again.
		<dd>If your game was downloaded from Steam, its <q>Verify Integrity Of Game Cache</q> command may add the Registry entry back again.
		<dd>Otherwise, reinstall your game. All BOSS's supported games create a Registry key that say where the game is installed when they are installed, so if your game's Registry entry is missing, it's not been installed correctly, or has broken since it was installed.
	<dt>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be found!
		<dd>Ensure <code>filename</code> exists. If <code>filename</code> is a BOSS Log and you are trying to open it from the GUI, make sure that you have run BOSS at least once with it set to generate the format of BOSS Log you are trying to view.

<h3 id="appendix-a">Appendix A: Dirty Edits, Mod Cleaning &amp; CRCs</h3>
<p>Dirty edits are often a side-effect of mod creation, and are often due to bugs in the utilities Bethesda has provided to create mods, rather than bad practice by mod authors. Dirty edits can cause a wide range of issues, including incorrect game settings, missing content, broken quests and crashing to desktop. The more dirty edits there are in a mod, and the more mods with dirty edits you use, the more likely you are to experience issues.
<p>Thankfully there is a way to remove dirty edits from mods relatively easily, a process known as <i>mod cleaning</i>, using TES4Edit (for Oblivion), FO3Edit (for Fallout 3), FNVEdit (for Fallout: New Vegas) or TES5Edit (for Skyrim). A detailed set of instructions and information on mod cleaning can be found on the CS Wiki's <a href="http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/TES4Edit_Cleaning_Guide">TES4Edit Cleaning Guide</a> (the page also applies to Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Skyrim). <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> can also scan plugins for dirty edits and return their ITM and UDR counts, though at the time of writing it cannot clean plugins itself.
<p>The problem of dirty edits is largely a problem of ignorance on the part of mod authors and users alike of the problems dirty mods can cause. As such, there are community efforts to raise awareness of dirty edits and cleaning. BOSS plays a key role in these efforts, as it holds the complete list of all known dirty mods, and it uses this information to provide notification messages to users for any dirty mods they have installed.
There are three key pieces of information that are used to accurately describe and identify an unclean mod. They are:
<ul>
	<li><i><abbr title="Identical To Master">ITM</abbr> Count</i>: ITM records are a type of dirty edit where a mod has overwritten something in the game without actually changing anything. If another mod lower in the load order makes an intentional change to that thing, it will have its effect cancelled out by the ITM record, which can cause problems. The ITM count is the number of ITM records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i><abbr title="Undeleted and Disabled Reference">UDR</abbr> Count</i>: Deleting records is a significant cause of crashes and game bugs. UDRs are records that the mod deleted from the game or from another mod that have been corrected safely by undeleting them and disabling them instead, which has the same intended effect without causing issues. The UDR count is the number of deleted reference records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i>CRC</i> or <i>Checksum</i>: A file's CRC is a highly accurate way of identifying it, and is a number calculated from the file's contents. If the contents of a file changes, so will its CRC. BOSS uses CRCs to check if a user's mods are dirty by checking their CRCs against pre-determined CRCs of known dirty mods. This lets BOSS give precise notification messages for any dirty mods it detects. BOSS can calculate the CRCs of all your installed plugins if run from the GUI with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled.
</ul>
<p>However, not all unclean mods have all or any of these pieces of information. For unclean mods whose ITM and UDR counts have not been reported, BOSS cannot give them. For unclean mods whose CRCs have not been reported, BOSS cannot give precise notification and so prints a message whether or not the user has cleaned their mod.
<p>BOSS and the modding communities rely on user contribution of this information to progress. For information on how to contribute, see the <a href="#help">Contributions &amp; Help</a> section below. If you find that a mod is dirty, you should also report this to the mod's author so that they can fix it.
<p><b>Note:</b> TES4Edit et al. will include a variety of <em>junk records</em> in the ITM count for a plugin, such as new empty cells that are automatically generated by the Construction Set and are almost impossible to remove. These junk records are non-harmful, and BOSS will inform users when a mod contains these to avoid confusion. This is also the source of any discrepancies between the counts produced by TES4Edit and those produced by <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>. The latter's counts are more technically accurate, but both are acceptable for use.
<p>There is also another type of unnecessary edit, known as a wild edit, that can also cause problems. These edits are neither Identical To Master edits nor deleted records, so cannot be automatically cleaned. Cleaning must be manually done in TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit. BOSS can still check for plugins with these edits if the CRCs of the plugins with wild edits are known, and it can provide notification of these edits and some information on fixing them if they are reported in an official BOSS thread.

<h3 id="appendix-b">Appendix B: False-Flagged Plugins</h3>
<p>Whether a mod plugin is a master file or a non-master file is dependent not on its file extension (<code>.esp</code>, <code>.esm</code>), but is instead decided by the value of a setting inside the plugin file, known as its <q>master bit flag</q>. Master files have this set to <code>1</code>, and non-master files have it set to <code>0</code>. However, because ESM is an acronym for <q>Elder Scrolls Master</q>, and ESP is an acronym for <q>Elder Scrolls Plugin</q> (even for Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas), most people assume that master plugins are files with <code>.esm</code> extensions, while non-master plugins are files with <code>.esp</code> extensions.
<p>This assumption is valid for the most part, as the vast majority of masters are <code>.esm</code> files, and the vast majority of plugins are <code>.esp</code> files. However, sometimes this is not the case. When a plugin has a <code>.esm</code> extension but has a master bit flag value of <code>0</code>, or has an extension of <code>.esp</code> and a master bit flag value of <code>1</code>, the plugin is said to be <q>false-flagged</q>, as its extension does not match its master bit flag value. False-flagged plugins are most common in Fallout 3 due to the use of FO3Edit's <q>Master Update</q> feature, which turns non-master plugins into false-flagged plugins, to avoid bugs that only manifest for non-master plugins.
<p>The distinction between masters and non-masters is important for load order because the game will always load all masters before all non-masters, regardless of whether they are listed or dated (depending on your game) as such by the mechanism used to determine load order. Earlier versions of BOSS, and most if not all mod managers, put all <code>.esm</code> files before all <code>.esp</code> files, but failed to take into account the value of the master bit flag of plugins. As such, the load order they displayed was incorrect, as it failed to take into account the game always loading masters before plugins.
<p>Since the master bit flag can be changed by users, it is not sufficient to update the masterlists to take into account the values of plugin master bit flags in the plugins available for download, as the user may have changed the master bit flag values (eg. using FO3Edit's Master Update). As such, BOSS instead checks that the masterlist used is ordering masters before non-masters, and moves any masters loading after non-masters so that they load before non-masters. If any masters are moved, it then displays a message in the BOSS Log to notify the user of this change. The BOSS Log does not detail which masters were moved.



<h3 id="appendix-c">Appendix C: File Permissions</h3>
<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:
<ol>
	<li>Install the game outside the <q>Program Files</q> (or <q>Program Files (x86)</q> if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.
	<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.
	<li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.
	<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the <q>BOSS.exe</q> and <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>, and select <q>Run as administrator</q>.
</ol>
<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.
	<li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.
	<li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.
	<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.
	<li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.
</ol>

<h3 id="appendix-d">Appendix D: International Character Support</h3>
<p>BOSS provides support for sorting plugins containing characters from any language via the Unicode character encoding, specifically UTF-8. All BOSS's files are encoded in UTF-8 by default. However, if you accidently save a file in another encoding, or need to convert an old userlist to UTF-8, here's how to convert a text file to UTF-8:
<ul>
	<li>Using Notepad:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
	<li>Using Notepad++:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad++.
			<li>Open the <q>Encoding</q> menu, then select <q>Convert to UTF-8</q>.
			<li>Save the file as normal.
		</ol>
</ul>
<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it. 


<h3 id="appendix-e">Appendix E: Introduction To Load Orders</h3>
<p>This appendix provides a general overview of load ordering in the games BOSS supports for those who are unfamiliar with the concept. For simplicity, <q>the game</q> will be used when the text refers to any of the games that BOSS supports.
<p>Mod plugins for the game are files that end in <code>.esp</code> or <code>.esm</code>. These files are created by the game's official editing tools, or by third party modders' tools. They contain various data entries. These entries can either be brand new additions, or changes to entries added by another plugin, including the game's main master file (Morrowind.esm, Oblivion.esm, Nehrim.esm, Skyrim.esm, Fallout3.esm or FalloutNV.esm depending on the game). Entries cover almost all aspects of what is in the game, eg. NPCs, items, races, interiors, worlds, quests, etc.
<p>When the game is run, it reads the contents of the active plugins and applies their entries in the order that the plugins are read. This leads to the <q>rule of one</q>, ie. one entry can only be modified by one plugin. As such, when several plugins modify the same entry, the plugin that is read last has its changes override the other plugins' changes for that entry. There is one exception to the <q>rule of one</q>, and that is that the contents of cells (the physical space in which your character moves) can be changed by any number of plugins, so different plugins can add objects to cells, move them around or remove them and all will see their changes applied by the game.
<p>This order in which the game reads active plugins is, unsurprisingly, what is referred to as the load order. By changing the load order, you can change which plugins override and which are overridden, and so reduce detrimental conflicts. You cannot actually reduce how much is overridden through load order alone, but it is often the case that some overrides are acceptable while others cause problems in game. Setting a good load order is the process by which you seek to maximise the former instead of the latter. That is why load order matters. 
<p>Further compatibility between mods is then possible through the use of patches, which are made to address incompatibilities between specific mods, and through the use of Wrye Bash, which can create a <q>Bashed Patch</q> that allows you to select between types of changes for different mods. For example, two mods change a piece of armour, but one changes how it looks and the other changes its effectiveness: through load order alone you could only ever get one change, but using Wrye Bash you can get both, because they change different things in the same armour entry.
<p>There are a few hardcoded rules that trump load order in many cases:
<ul>
 <li>Master plugins always load before non-master plugins. This is discussed in greater detail in <a href="appendix-b">Appendix B: False-Flagged Plugins</a>.
 <li>There is a limit of 255 active plugins that can be loaded by the game. This isn't strictly a load <em>order</em> thing, but is worth mentioning.
 <li>In Skyrim, <code>Skyrim.esm</code> always loads before all other plugins.
 <li>In Skyrim, if <code>Update.esm</code> is present, it is always loaded. If it has no load order position set, it loads after all other master plugins. That might sound a bit odd, but thanks to Skyrim's load order mechanism, it is possible for it to have no set load order position, even though it is always loaded.
</ul>
<p>That's all that you as a mod user <em>need</em> to know about load orders. If you want to find out more about the actual mechanism by which the game decides the load order, read on.
<p>Morrowind, Oblivion, Nehrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas all share the same mechanism for deciding load order (though Morrowind uses a different file to list its active load order in - but that won't be discussed here). Skyrim, since the 1.4.26 patch, uses a different mechanism.
<p>Load order for Morrowind, Oblivion, Nehrim, Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas is decided by the modification date timestamps of the mod plugins. The active plugin with the earliest date loads first, with plugins being listed in descending date order (earliest to latest). It's a bad idea for a plugin that isn't the game's main master file to load first.
<p>Skyrim's mechanism uses the order that plugins are listed within its <code>plugins.txt</code> file as its load order (from top to bottom). This file is the one in which the list of active plugins is stored, so only active plugins can be strictly said to have a load order. As any further discussion of this and its consequences gets a bit technical, see the <a href="BOSS%20API%20Readme.html">BOSS API Readme</a> for more information.
