	</ul>
	<p>Better Oblivion Sorting Software (BOSS) will re-order your mods to their correct positions, putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.</p>
	<p>BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods such as FCOM, MMM, FOOK and nVamp, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there 
	(estimated at about 25,000 for Oblivion, 12,000 for Fallout 3 and 6,000 for Fallout: New Vegas) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for the relevant game is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.</p>
	</div>
	<br /><br />
	
	<div id="install"><span>Installation &amp; Basic Usage</span>
	<p>BOSS can be installed for use with Oblivion, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas or Nehrim - At Fate's Edge (a Total Conversion mod for Oblivion). Installation may either be automated, using the BOSS Installer package, or manually, using the archive package. Either method is simple, and instructions for manual installation are given below.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you have Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV, make sure the <q>Lock Times</q> function is deactivated.</li>
		<li>If upgrading from an earlier version of BOSS, delete all BOSS files and folders in your game's Data folder (including the BOSS folder, BOSS.exe, masterlist.txt, modlist.txt, modlist.old, BOSSlog.txt and any of BOSS's .bat files).  If you have an edited masterlist, make sure to keep a backup so that your edits are not lost. It is recommended that you instead use the userlist functionality to apply changes to the masterlist.</li>
		<li>Extract the BOSS archive you downloaded to your game's installation directory (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q> or <q>fallout new vegas</q> depending on your game), so that there is now a BOSS folder alongside the Data folder and the game's executable.</li>
		<li>In the BOSS folder, run the <q>BOSS.exe</q>. This will download the latest masterlist from the Internet and then sort your mods.</li>
		<li>Thereafter when running BOSS, you may run it directly from the BOSS.exe to simply update your masterlist then sort your mods, or you can use the GUI to choose how BOSS runs.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you are installing BOSS manually and have more than one of the supported games installed, you should install BOSS separately for each one.</p>
	<p>Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV will automatically import and apply Bash Tag 
	suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV if necessary.</p>
	<p>You will need to reorder unrecognised mods by hand using <abbr title="Oblivion Mod Manager">OBMM</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Mod Manager">FOMM</abbr> or Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV.</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="remove"><span>Uninstallation</span>
	<p>Delete the BOSS folder in your game's installation folder (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q> or <q>fallout new vegas</q> depending on your game).</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="advanced"><span>General &amp; Advanced Usage</span><br /><br />
	<span class="subtitle" id="gui">The Graphical User Interface</span>
	<p>BOSS comes with a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> that provides easy access to almost all of BOSS's functions and features. It allows you to:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Change BOSS's output options:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Show BOSSlog On Completion</i>: Open the BOSSlog automatically after BOSS is finished.</li>
			<li><i>Enable Debug Output</i>: Add source code references to the command line output.</li>
			<li><i>Log Command Line Output</i>: Save the command line output to a <q>BOSSCommandLineLog.txt</q> text file.</li>
			<li><i>BOSSlog Format</i>: Specify the format of the BOSSlog generated.</li>
			<li><i>Command Line Verbosity</i>: The verbosity of the command line logging output. As values increase, so does verbosity, 'Standard (0)' displays only warning and error messages.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Easily select from the three main modes of operation BOSS can run in, and specify their run options:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Sort Mods</i>: The standard mode of operation, sorting your mods. Its options are:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Update Masterlist</i>: Run the masterlist updater during BOSS's operation.</li>
				<li><i>Display Mod Versions</i>: Display in the BOSSlog the version information extracted from plugin descriptions.</li>
				<li><i>Display File CRCs</i>: Calculate and display in the BOSSlog the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, and of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins.</li>
				<li><i>Perform Trial Run</i>: When BOSS is run, simulate its changes to your load order without actually reordering your mods.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><i>Update Masterlist Only</i>: Updates your masterlist then immediately quits. Its option is:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Game</i>: The game is BOSS installed for. This affects which masterlist BOSS downloads and which master file to look for. 'Autodetect' tells BOSS to decide for itself based on what master file is present.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
			<li><i>Undo Changes</i>: Sorts your mods into the order they were in before you last ran BOSS, or the order they were in before the second-last time you ran BOSS, depending on the revert level chosen. Its options are:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Undo Level</i>: Specify how many runs of BOSS to undo.</li>
				<li><i>Display Mod Versions</i>: Display in the BOSSlog the version information extracted from plugin descriptions.</li>
				<li><i>Display File CRCs</i>: Calculate and display in the BOSSlog the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, and of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins.</li>
			</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Launch BOSS.</li>
		<li>Open your userlist for editing.</li>
		<li>Open your BOSSlog for viewing.</li>
		<li>Open BOSS's ReadMes.</li>
		<li>Launch the <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality, which includes an automatic updater that can get new releases of BOSS for you. The <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality also runs when the GUI launches, but only displays a message if an update was found or there was an error encountered while checking.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Each setting in the GUI corresponds to a command line parameter (apart from <q>Log Command Line Output</q>), the details of which can be found in the <a href="#details">Further Details</a> section below. The settings for the <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality, including proxy settings, are only found in the <q>BOSS.ini</q> settings file, there are no GUI options for them.</p>
	<p>Note that the BOSSlog format selection applies to both the format of the BOSSlog that will be generated when BOSS is run and the format that the GUI will try to open when you select <q>View BOSSlog</q>.</p>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle" id="bosslog">The BOSS Log</span>
	<p>The BOSSlog is where you will find all of BOSS's outputted information. It can be generated in either HTML format (the default) or as a plain text file with minimal formatting. The HTML format has significant advantages over the plain text format, being considerably easier to read, containing colour-coded messages and a variety of filters to customise what is displayed. Both formats, however, contain the same information.</p>
	<p>The HTML BOSSlog has been tested in Mozilla Firefox 4, Google Chrome 11, Opera 11 and Internet Explorer 9. Using earlier browsers may result in parts of the BOSSlog not working or displaying correctly.</p>
	<p>The BOSSlog comprises of a number of sections, them being:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><i>Masterlist Update</i>: This section is only displayed if you have run BOSS with the <q>Update Masterlist</q> or <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> options enabled, and details the success or failure of the update.</li>
		<li><i>General Messages</i>: This section is only displayed if there are any applicable messages to be displayed. Its primary purpose is to allow BOSS to display messages specific to your Oblivion install that are not specific to any one mod, for example if an update to BOSS or OBSE is available.</li>
		<li><i>Summary</i>: This section gives breakdowns of the numbers of plugins you have installed and the number of messages BOSS has attached to them. It also displays a notice if there has been no change to your recognised mod list since you last ran BOSS.</li>
		<li><i>Userlist Messages</i>: This section is only displayed if BOSS finds a userlist.txt in your BOSS folder. In this section the successes or failures of the application of your userlist rules will be detailed.</li>
		<li><i>Script Extender And Script Extender Plugins Checksums</i>: This section is displayed when BOSS is run with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled and you have your game's Script Extender installed. It will list the Script Extender and any plugins you have installed, displaying their versions if given and their CRCs.</li>
		<li><i>Recognised And Re-ordered Plugins</i> or <i>Restored Load Order</i>: This section comprises the bulk of BOSS's output, listing all your recognised installed plugins and any messages BOSS has attached to them, as well as version information (if given) and the plugin CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled). When BOSS is run to undo its changes, this section will list your restored load order.</li>
		<li><i>Unrecognised Plugins</i>: This section lists any plugins you have installed that have not been recognised by BOSS. These plugins should be reported in an official BOSS thread with download links to their mods so they can be added to the masterlist.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>BOSS will display the version numbers of any plugins that provide version information in their description fields. If a plugin does not supply any version information, no version number will be displayed for it. The version number of plugins may occasionally not match the version of the mod installed, this is due to the mod author forgetting to update the plugin's version information. When in doubt, check the version number given in a mod's readme.</p>
	<p>It should be noted that the vast majority of BOSS's mod messages are non-conditional, in that they are not displayed in response to your specific install. For example, a message that gives some of the mod's incompatibilities does not know if you have them installed or not, and a message telling you to do something will not know if it has been done.</p>
	<p>BOSS's mod messages are one of the most important features BOSS provides, acting as a means of providing users with information that they might otherwise not obtain. It is important for a stable, healthy game that you act on any messages that require action. If you think a message suggests an action that is not necessary, report it to an official BOSS thread.</p>
	<p>The HTML BOSSlog includes a few features and a number of filters to customise what is displayed. The majority of these are found in the shaded box near the top of the BOSSlog, and are enabled and disabled via their checkboxes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Collapsible Sections</i>: This does not have a checkbox. Instead, clicking on a section's header will collapse that section, hiding its contents. Clicking the header again will expand the section, making its contents visible again.</li>
		<li><i>Use Dark Colour Scheme</i>: This will change the BOSSlog's colour scheme to a darker variety, more suitable for reading in low light levels and putting less strain on the eyes. Users with vision impairments may find the darker colour scheme easier to read.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Rule Warnings</i>: This hides any warning messages printed in the <q>Userlist Messages</q> section of the BOSSlog.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Version Numbers</i>: This will hide the version numbers printed in blue next to those mods that provide them.</li>
		<li><i>Hide 'Ghosted' Label</i>: This will hide the 'Ghosted' printed in grey next to any mods ghosted by Wrye Bash.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Checksums</i>: This will hide the checksums of mods and Script Extender plugins printed in brown next to their names.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Messageless Mods</i>: This will hide any recognised mods that do not have messages attached to them.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Ghosted Mods</i>: This will hide any mods that have been ghosted by Wrye Bash.</li>
		<li><i>Hide All Mod Nessages</i>: This hides all the messages attached to all recognised mods.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Notes</i>: This hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Note: </q> prefix.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Bash Tag Suggestions</i>: This hides any Bash Tag suggestions attached to mods.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Requirements</i>: This hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Requires: </q> prefix.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Incompatibilities</i>: This hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Incompatible with: </q> prefix.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is not possible to hide mod warning or error messages, as these are of a severity where they should almost certainly be acted upon, and not ignored. Be aware that if you hide all a mod's messages and then hide all messageless mods, that mod will be amongst those hidden.</p>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle" id="dirtymods">Dirty Edits, Mod Cleaning &amp; CRCs</span>
	<p>
	<p>Dirty edits are often a side-effect of mod creation, and are often due to bugs in the utilities Bethesda has provided to create mods, rather than bad practice by mod authors. Dirty edits can cause a wide range of issues, including incorrect game settings, missing content, broken quests and crashing to desktop. The more dirty edits there are, and the more mods with dirty edits you use, the more likely you are to experience issues.</p>
	<p>Thankfully there is a way to remove dirty edits from mods relatively easily, a process known as <i>mod cleaning</i>, using TES4Edit (for Oblivion), FO3Edit (for Fallout 3) or FNVEdit (for Fallout: New Vegas). A detailed set of instructions and information on mod cleaning can be found on the CS Wiki's <a href="http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/TES4Edit_Cleaning_Guide">TES4Edit Cleaning Guide</a> (the page also applies to Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas).</p>
	<p>The problem of dirty edits is largely a problem of ignorance on the part of mod authors and users alike of the problems unclean mods (more widely known as <i>dirty mods</i>) can cause. As such, there are community efforts to raise awareness of dirty edits and cleaning. BOSS plays a key role in these efforts, as holds the complete list of all known dirty mods, and it uses this information to provide notification messages to users for any dirty mods they have installed.
	There are three key pieces of information that are used to accurately describe and identify an unclean mod. They are:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>ITM Count</i>: ITM (Identical To Master) records are a type of dirty edit where a mod has overwritten something in the game without actually changing anything. If another mod lower in the load order makes an intentional change to that thing, it will have its effect cancelled out by the ITM record, which can cause problems. The ITM count is the number of ITM records found and corrected in the mod plugin.</li>
		<li><i>UDR Count</i>: Deleting records is a significant cause of crashes and game bugs. UDR (Undeleted and Disabled Reference) records are records that the mod deleted from the game or from another mod that have been corrected safely by undeleting them and disabling them instead, which has the same intended effect without causing issues. The UDR count is the number of deleted reference records found and corrected in the mod plugin.</li>
		<li><i>CRC</i> or <i>Checksum</i>: A file's CRC is a highly accurate way of identifying it, and is a number calculated from the file's contents. If the contents of a file changes, so will its CRC. BOSS uses CRCs to check if a user's mods are dirty by checking their CRCs against pre-determined CRCs of known dirty mods. This lets BOSS give precise notification messages for any dirty mods it detects. BOSS can calculate the CRCs of all your installed plugins if run from the GUI with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>However, not all unclean mods have all or any of these pieces of information. For unclean mods whose ITM and UDR counts have not been reported, BOSS cannot give them. For unclean mods whose CRCs have not been reported, BOSS cannot give precise notification and so prints a message whether or not the user has cleaned their mod.</p>
	<p>BOSS and the modding communities rely on user contribution of this information to progress. For information on how to contribute, see the <a href="#help">Contributions &amp; Help</a> section below. If you find that a mod is dirty, you should also report this to the mod's author so that they can fix it.</p>
	<p>There is also another type of unnecessary edit, known as a wild edit, that can also cause problems. These edits are neither Itentical To Master edits nor deleted records, so cannot be automatically cleaned. Cleaning must be manually done in TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit. BOSS can still check for mods with these edits if the CRCs of the plugins with wild edits are known, and it can provide notification of these edits and some information on fixing them if they are reported in an official BOSS thread.</p>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle" id="special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</span>
	<p>The vast majority of users will be able to use BOSS's masterlist updater and the GUI's auto-updater with no problems. However, some users' circumstances may be such that the standard method will not work. This section provides instructions for those users.</p>
	<p>The most common special circumstance is when the computer the user has BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet. Merely transferring BOSS.exe to another computer and running it is not sufficient, as by default BOSS tries to autodetect the game it is installed for, and if there is no game present it will exit with an error. In this circumstance, the following instructions should be used to obtain masterlist updates:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Copy <q>BOSS.exe</q> and <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> from your BOSS folder to the computer with an Internet connection, ensuring they are in the same folder.</li>
		<li>If your Internet connection is through a proxy, you will also need to copy across your <q>BOSS.ini</q> to ensure the proxy settings you have recorded in it are applied. Make sure you have recorded your proxy settings in your BOSS.ini!</li>
		<li>Run the BOSS GUI.exe and select the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> option. For the <q>Game</q> option below, select your game from the drop-down list. This will tell BOSS which game's masterlist to download.</li>
		<li>Select <q>Run BOSS</q>. Your masterlist will be downloaded into the same folder as your BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe. A BOSSlog will also be created, you can delete this.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>A rarer circumstance is when the user connects to the Internet using a proxy. This is most common in enterprise environments, and such users will generally know if they use a proxy. If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you must manually enter your proxy settings into your <q>BOSS.ini</q> settings file. See the section on the BOSS.ini in the <a href="#customising">Customising How BOSS Works</a> section below for details.</p>
	<p>If your circumstances are such that the computer you have BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet, or if you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, it is recommended that you avoid using the GUI's auto-updater, simply because it is easier in these circumstances to download new releases through your web browser.</p>
	<p>There may also be other special cases that cause problems for BOSS's updaters, including some Internet proxies, that the BOSS team are unaware of. If you are having issues using the updaters, contact the BOSS team for support.</p>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle" id="customising">Customising How BOSS Works</span>
	<p>Users can customise how BOSS handles their mods through the included User Rules feature. This feature allows you to define the positions of mods not in the masterlist, and to override the masterlist positions of mods,
	as well as edit the output messages of mods, and more. In addition, this is all done without editing the masterlist.txt, so when you update it using the built-in updater, your changes are not lost. All the information on the User Rules feature can be found in the "BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html" file.</p>
	<p>Users can also edit a number of BOSS's default settings in the BOSS.ini. As this is where BOSS gets its settings from, care must be taken to edit it correctly to prevent breaking BOSS's operation. The ini is split into the following sections:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><i>BOSS.InternetSettings</i>: These settings control how the masterlist updater and GUI auto-updater connect to the Internet. They are shared by BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe, and can be overriden for the masterlist updater using BOSS's command line parameters. There is no GUI method for altering these settings. You will probably know if you need to alter them.
		<ul>
			<li><i>ProxyType</i>: The type of proxy used, if one is required to connect to the Internet. Valid values are: 
			'<code>direct</code>', 
			'<code>http</code>', 
			'<code>http1_0</code>', 
			'<code>socks4</code>', 
			'<code>socks4a</code>', 
			'<code>socks5</code>' and 
			'<code>socks5h</code>' (SOCKS 5 with proxy-based hostname resolution). '<code>direct</code>' tells BOSS to use no proxy. Default is '<code>direct</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>ProxyHostname</i>: The hostname for the proxy host used, if a proxy is required to connect to the Internet. The hostname may be '<code>none</code>', an actual hostname (eg. proxy.company.com) or an IP address (eg. 192.168.32.4). 'none' tells BOSS to use no proxy. Default is '<code>none</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>ProxyPort</i>: The port used to connect to the proxy host, if a proxy is required to connect to the Internet. The port number may be any valid port number. '<code>0</code>' tells BOSS to use no proxy. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>BOSS.RunOptions</i>: These settings specify BOSS.exe's run options. They allow you to run BOSS with non-default settings without having to use the command line or the GUI. Unless otherwise stated, they are binary toggles, so '<code>1</code>' switches them on and '<code>0</code>' switches them off.
		<ul>
			<li><i>UpdateMasterlist</i>: Run the masterlist updater. Default is '<code>1</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>OnlyUpdateMasterlist</i>: Exit BOSS immediately after running the masterlist updater. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>DisableMasterlistUpdate</i>: Inhibit the masterlist updater. Overrides UpdateMasterlist. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>Game</i>: The game is BOSS installed for. This affects which masterlist BOSS downloads and which master file to look for. Valid values are: '<code>auto</code>', '<code>Oblivion</code>', '<code>Nehrim</code>', '<code>Fallout3</code>', and '<code>FalloutNV</code>'. '<code>auto</code>' tells BOSS to auto-detect the game. Default is '<code>auto</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>SilentRun</i>: Do not open the BOSSlog automatically after BOSS is finished. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>NoVersionParse</i>: Do not parse plugin header description fields for their version numbers. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>RevertLevel</i>: Specify how many runs of BOSS to undo. Valid values are: '<code>0</code>', '<code>1</code>' and '<code>2</code>'. '0' tells BOSS to run as normal. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>CommandLineVerbosity</i>: The verbosity of the command line logging output. Valid values are: '<code>0</code>', '<code>1</code>', '<code>2</code>' and '<code>3</code>'. As values increase, so does verbosity, '<code>0</code>' displays only warning and error messages. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>Debug</i>: Add source code references to debug output. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>DisplayCRCs</i>: Calculate and display the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, and of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>BOSSlogFormat</i>: Specify the format of the BOSSlog generated. Valid values are: '<code>html</code>', '<code>text</code>'. Default is '<code>html</code>'.</li>
			<li><i>DoTrialRun</i>: Run BOSS and simulate its changes to your load order without actually reordering your mods. Default is '<code>0</code>'.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>GUI.Settings</i>: These settings control aspects of the GUI's behaviour. There is no GUI method for altering them. Unless otherwise stated, they are binary toggles, so '<code>1</code>' switches them on and '<code>0</code>' switches them off.
		<ul>
			<li><i>DoStartupUpdateCheck</i>: Check for updates to BOSS when the GUI is launched. Default is '<code>1</code>'.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><i>GUI.LastOptions</i>: These settings record the options last selected by the user in the GUI. As these settings are automatically loaded when the GUI starts and saved when it exits, it is not recommended that you alter them manually.</li>
		<li><i>BOSSlog.Filters</i>: These settings control the default states of the BOSSlog filters. If a filter's default is set to be enabled, then it will be enabled and applied when the BOSSlog is opened. These settings are all binary toggles, so '<code>1</code>' enables them and '<code>0</code>' disables them. By default all filters are disabled. See the earlier <a href="#bosslog">The BOSS Log</a> section for what each filter does.

	<p>If BOSS is run and it cannot find a BOSS.ini, it will generate a new one. If BOSS is run with both a BOSS.ini present and command line parameters set, the command line parameters override the settings in BOSS.ini.</p>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle" id="linux">Running BOSS Under Linux</span>
	<p>It is possible to run BOSS on Linux through the Wine compatibility layer, though no official support for doing so is given. Installation and usage is as on Windows. 
	It is also possible to compile BOSS natively for Linux, and makefiles are provided, although there is again no official support for doing so. Native Linux builds are case-sensitive in their recognising of mods in the masterlist, and while mods are generally added with the correct case, occasionally a mod might have the incorrect case which would cause problems for a user with a native Linux build.</p>

	<div id="details"><span>Further Details</span><br />
	<br /><span class="subtitle" id="cli">Command Line Arguments</span>
	<p>The BOSS GUI acts as a frontend to BOSS, and its output and run options correspond to BOSS's command line arguments. The syntax for these arguments is:</p>
	<div>
	<p><code>boss [-hVuosndctU] [-g [game]] [-r [level]] [-v [level]] [-f [type]] [-T [type]] [-H [hostname]] [-P [port]]</code></p>
	<p><code>-h [ --help ]</code></p>
	<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments, then exits.</p>
	<p><code>-V [ --version ]</code></p>
	<p>Prints the a banner displaying the program name and version number to the command line, then exits.</p>
	<p><code>-u [ --update ]</code></p>
	<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sorts your mods. Since this replaces your current 
	masterlist, don't run this if you have an edited copy and wish to keep the changes.</p>
	<p><code>-o [ --only-update ]</code></p>
	<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then does <b>not</b> sort your mods. Since this replaces your current 
	masterlist, don't run this if you have an edited copy and wish to keep the changes.</p>
	<p><code>-g [ --game ] [ game ]</code></p>
	<p>Overrides game autodetection. The valid values of the argument are: 'Oblivion', 'Nehrim', 'Fallout3', and 'FalloutNV'. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS will fail before any mods are sorted, so this should be used in conjunction with -o.</p>
	<p><code>-s [ --silent ]</code></p>
	<p>Stops BOSS from automatically opening up the BOSSlog in your web browser (or text editor, depending on format chosen) after it has finished running.</p>
	<p><code>-n [ --no-version-parse ]</code></p>
	<p>Disables the parsing of each mod's description to extract the author's version information, so it is not printed alongside the other data in the BOSSlog. This can be used if the version 
	parsing is not working properly for some of your mods and you wish to remove the version notes.</p>
	<p><code>-r [ --revert ] [ level ]</code></p>
	<p>Revert to a previous load order. This parameter optionally accepts values of 1 or 2, indicating how many undo steps to apply. If no option is specified, it defaults to 1. A value of 1 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
	A value of 2 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.</p>
	<p><code>-v [ --verbose ] [ level ]</code></p>
	<p>Specify verbosity level (0-3). 0 is the default, showing only warning and error messages. 1 (warning, error and informational messages) is implied if this option is specified without an argument. Higher values increase the verbosity further.</p>
	<p><code>-d [ --debug ]</code></p>
	<p>Adds source file references (filenames and line numbers) to logging statements.</p>
	<p><code>-c [ --crc-display ]</code></p>
	<p>Calculates the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder and displays them in your BOSSlog alongside the plugin names. The version numbers and CRCs of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins will also be displayed in your BOSSlog.</p>
	<p><code>-f [ --format ] [ type ]</code></p>
	<p>Allows the selection of the BOSSlog format. Valid argument values are: 'html' and 'text'. 'html' is the default output format. The 'text' value will print the BOSSlog as plain text into a 'BOSSlog.txt' file, similar to the BOSSlog in BOSS v1.5 and below.</p>
	<p><code>-t [ --trial-run ]</code></p>
	<p>BOSS runs, but no mods are redated, so your load order is not changed. The BOSSlog still displays the order BOSS would have placed them in, so it is useful for checking what would happen if you ran BOSS on your load order without having to then undo BOSS's changes.</p>
	<p><code>-U [ --no-update ]</code></p>
	<p>Inhibits the default automatic masterlist updater, preventing it from running. Must not be used alongside --update,-u.</p>
	<p><code>-T [ --proxy-type ] [ type ]</code></p>
	<p>Sets the proxy type for the masterlist updater. Valid values are: 'direct', 'http', 'http1_0', 'socks4', 'socks4a', 'socks5' and 'socks5h' (SOCKS 5 with proxy-based hostname resolution). 'direct' is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy. Other types of proxy are not currently supported.</p>
	<p><code>-H [ --proxy-host ] [ hostname ]</code></p>
	<p>Sets the proxy hostname for the masterlist updater. The hostname may be an actual hostname (eg. proxy.company.com), an IP address (eg. 192.168.32.4) or 'none'. 'none' is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.</p>
	<p><code>-P [ --proxy-port ] [ port ]</code></p>
	<p>Sets the proxy port number for the masterlist updater. The port number may be any valid port number. '0' is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.</p>
	</div><br />
	
	<span class="subtitle" id="files">BOSS Changes and Files</span>
	<p>The only changes BOSS makes to your game install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, and create a few files in your BOSS folder. Your game's master file (Oblivion.esm, Fallout3.esm, Nehrim.esm or FalloutNV.esm) 
	is never touched, and all dates are derived from it.</p>
	<div>BOSS's files are all found in the BOSS folder, and they are:
	<ul>
		<li><i>BOSSlog.html</i> - This log is where the output that BOSS generates and displays once the program ends is stored. It is replaced every time you run BOSS. You can view it in any web browser.</li>
		<li><i>BOSSlog.txt</i> - This file is the same as the above BOSSlog.html, but the information is given in plaintext instead of with HTML formatting. It is only created if you specify the 'text' format when running BOSS. You can view it in any text editor.</li>
		<li><i>masterlist.txt</i> - This is the master list of mods that BOSS recognises, listing them in order and which includes notes attached to them. It is the most frequently updated component of BOSS, receiving updates almost every day.</li>
		<li><i>modlist.txt</i> - This file contains the list of your mods in the order they were before you last ran BOSS, which can be used to undo changes to your load order.</li>
		<li><i>modlist.old</i> - This file contains the contents of your modlist.txt before you last ran BOSS, providing a second level of undo for load order changes.</li>
		<li><i>userlist.txt</i> - This file contains your custom rules to be implemented by the User Rules feature.</li>
		<li><i>BOSS.ini</i> - This file stores BOSS's settings, including the default run options, the default BOSSlog filters and more.</li>
	</ul>

	<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.</p>
	<p>Lists of unrecognised mods are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).</li>
		<li>A link to where the description, mod or readme can be found to read or download.</li>
		<li>A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Lists of unclean mods are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).</li>
		<li>The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit (not the number of records processed).</li>
		<li>The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit (not the number of records processed).</li>
		<li>The CRC(s) of the unlcean ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the uncleaned files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the <q>CRC checksum for data</q> is the one required.</li>

	<div id="troubleshooting"><span>Troubleshooting</span><br /><br />
	<p>In some circumstances BOSS may not be able to run properly, due to a variety of possible reasons. In such cases, an error message detailing the problem should be provided. If the program unexpectedly crashes, or you experience 
	a problem for which no error message is given, please report the crash or problem to an official BOSS thread (linked to in the <a href="#links">Quick Links</a> section below), so that we may fix it.</p>
	<p>If the information below does not help you to solve any problems you are experiencing, please seek further support in one of the official BOSS threads.</p>
	<span class="subtitle" id="general">General Problems</span>
	<p>There are a few general reasons why BOSS may fail to function correctly. Check if any of the symptoms listed below fit your issue.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> No change in load order.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Wrye Bash's <q>Lock Times</q> load order locking feature is enabled.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Disable <q>Lock Times</q> before running BOSS. If you are using Wrye Bash v277 or later and running BOSS from Wrye Bash, this is done for you, and <q>Lock Times</q> is then re-activated after BOSS has run.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not change/update the BOSSlog and/or modlists correctly.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> The BOSSlog and/or modlists are read-only, or the BOSS folder is read-only.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure that the BOSS folder and any files in it are not read-only.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not recognise the mods in my userlist correctly, and/or replaces some of the letters in their names with question marks.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Your userlist is not encoded in UTF-8.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Save your userlist in the UTF-8 encoding.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> You had mods in your userlist with non-Latin letters in their names, and saved your userlist in a non-UTF8 encoding before saving it in UTF-8.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Rewrite the filenames in your userlist, copy/pasting them from the files themselves to ensure they are correct.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> Some mods have the wrong or no version number given in the BOSSlog.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> This occurs because BOSS looks for the version number in the plugin's description field. If the mod author has forgotten to update the version number there or not provided one, an incorrect or no version number will be displayed.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> No solution, other than the mod author including a correct version number in the plugin's description field for a later release.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>

	<span class="subtitle" id="permissions">File Permissions</span>
	<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Install the game outside the <q>Program Files</q> (or <q>Program Files (x86)</q> if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.</li>
		<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.</li>
		<li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.</li>
		<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the BOSS.exe, and select <q>Run as administrator</q>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.</li>
		<li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.</li>
		<li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.</li>
		<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.</li>
		<li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.</li>
	</ol>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle" id="international">International Character Support</span>
	<p>BOSS provides support for sorting mods containing characters from any language via the Unicode character encoding, specifically UTF-8. If your userlist contains any non-English characters, it <b>must</b>
	be encoded in UTF-8 for BOSS to read it correctly. <b>This is not Notepad's default encoding!</b> If you need to convert a file's encoding, here are some instructions:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>Using Notepad:
			<ol>
				<li>Open the file in Notepad.</li>
				<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.</li>
				<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.</li>
				<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Using Notepad++:
			<ol>
				<li>Open the file in Notepad++.</li>
				<li>Open the <q>Encoding</q> menu, then select <q>Convert to UTF-8</q>.</li>
				<li>Save the file as normal.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.</p>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle" id="errors">Error Messages</span>
	<p>If BOSS can detect a specific reason for being unable to function correctly, it will print an error message detailing the problem. BOSS's error messages are listed below, along with details of the issues and possible solutions. The list does not include any messages related to user rule application.</p>
	<ul>
		<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> Error: file '<em>filename</em>' could not be accessed for writing.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the given file if it exists.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>

			<li><b>Issue:</b> Your master .ESM file is deactivated and ghosted by Wrye Bash/Flash.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-activate your master .ESM file.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> Error: Masterlist update failed.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Masterlist cannot be opened.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that your BOSS folder (and masterlist.txt if it exists) is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Curl error.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> There was a problem in getting information from the Internet. Depending on the error given, make sure your Internet connection is working correctly, or try again later. If you use a proxy make sure that the proxy service is running.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Cannot find online masterlist revision number.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> The layout of the Google Code page has changed, and a program update will be required to take account of this. Please report this issue in the official forum thread.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Invalid proxy hostname or port specified.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Invalid proxy type specified.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Double check that you have entered your proxy settings into the BOSS.ini correctly.</li>

		<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> Update check failed: No Internet connection detected.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS cannot detect any Internet connection.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> If you are certain that you do have an Internet connection, it could be because you use a proxy to connect to the Internet. Enter your proxy connection details into the relevant parts of the BOSS.ini and try again. 
			If you are unsure whether you are using a proxy and are trying to use BOSS in an enterprise environment, contact your network administrator for your proxy details. If you continue to have difficulty or are not using a proxy, contact the BOSS development team for further support.</li>

		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> <em>filename</em> does not exist, is in the wrong place, or is corrupt in some way.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> If <em>filename</em> is your game's master .ESM file and this error is displayed, it means that your master .ESM file exists, but its date cannot be read. This can only take place under very specialised circumstances, such as corruption of your master .ESM file, and probably means you will have to seek expert help.</li>

		<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> Error: Could not change the date of "<em>filename</em>", make sure you have write access to it.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the plugin given.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Check that the plugin is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: "<em>filename</em>" is not encoded in valid UTF-8. Please save the file using the UTF-8 encoding.
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> If <em>filename</em> is 'userlist.txt', BOSS has detected that your userlist.txt is saved using the wrong encoding, and is unable to read it.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save the file given in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. If you are unsure on how to do so, follow these instructions:
			<ol>
				<li>Open the file in Notepad.</li>
				<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.</li>
				<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.</li>
				<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.</li>

	<div id="history"><span>Version History</span>
	<p>The changelogs for each release of BOSS are listed below. The masterlists are updated far too frequently for their changes to be concisely recorded here, but a full history of changes to them may be viewed by browsing the Google Code repository.</p>
	<p><b>Version 1.8</b> - <i>July 2011</i></p>
	<ul>

			<li>Moved the section to the top of the BOSSlog.</li>
			<li>Renamed the section from <q>Plugin Numbers</q> to <q>Summary</q>.</li>
			<li>Added message counts, with numbers of total messages, warning messages and error messages.</li>
			<li>Added a notice that is displayed when there has been no change in the recognised mod list since BOSS was last run.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Added: Support for unauthenticated proxies to the masterlist updater and the GUI's <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality:
		<ul>
			<li>Added --proxy-host,-H [ hostname ] command line parameter to specify a proxy's host server for the masterlist updater.</li>
			<li>Added --proxy-port,-P [ port ] command line parameter to specify a proxy's port for the masterlist updater.</li>

		</ul>
		</li>
		<li>Added: Support for Fallout: New Vegas mods that use the Fallout 3 master file, such as <q>A Requiem for the Capital Wasteland</q>.</li>
		<li>Added: A settings file (<q>BOSS.ini</q>) to allow users to set default behaviours, options and BOSSlog formatting styles. All command line parameters have equivalent ini settings.</li>
		<li>Added: --trial-run,-t command line parameter to run BOSS without actually changing the load order.</li>
		<li>Added: --no-update,-U command line parameter to inhibit automatic masterlist updating.</li>

		<li>(GUI) Changed: The <q>Masterlist Update</q> checkbox now sets the --no-update command line parameter if unchecked to override BOSS's default behaviour.</li>

		<li>(GUI) Changed: Overhauled the <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality:
		<ul>
			<li>Removed the masterlist update checker, as it has been made redundant by BOSS's automatic masterlist updating.</li>
			<li>Added automatic updater functionality. Replaced <q>Check For Updates</q> output window with a series of notification dialogs asking if the update should be downloaded and installed. If no update was found, or there was an error, relevant dialog messages are displayed.</li>
			<li><q>Check For Updates</q> now also automatically runs when the GUI starts. This only displays a message if an update was found.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>

		<li>(GUI) Added: <q>Perform Trial Run</q> option.</li>
