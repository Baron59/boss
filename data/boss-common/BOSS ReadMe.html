<div id="features"><h1>Features &amp; Introduction</h1>
<ul>
	<li>Correctly positions over 19,100 mod plugins and counting for TES IV: Oblivion, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Nehrim - At Fate's Edge.
	<ul><li>Over 13,000 / 2,900 / 3,100 / 180 mod plugins respectively.</ul>
	<li>Supports mod plugins for TES V: Skyrim.
	<li>Provides a large number of usage notes for many plugins, including requirements, incompatibilities, updates and bug warnings.
	<li>Provides detection and warning of installation mistakes for some popular mods, such as FCOM.
	<li>Displays the version number of plugins when it is available.
	<li>Provides Bash Tag suggestions that are automatically applied by Wrye Bash (for Oblivion), Wrye Flash (for Fallout 3), Wrye Flash NV (for Fallout: New Vegas) or Wrye Smash (for Skyrim).
	<li>Sorts plugins ghosted by the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities.
	<li>Allows easy user customisation of mod positions and the messages provided.
	<li>Includes both <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> and <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> clients, offering full functionality and ease-of-use for all users.
	<li>Includes a semi-automatic updater to ensure that you always have the latest version installed.
	<li>Is under constant development and improvement by a team of modders and experts on all supported games.
</ul>
<p>Better Oblivion Sorting Software (BOSS) will re-order your mod plugins to their correct positions, putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.
<p>BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods such as FCOM, MMM, FOOK and nVamp, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there 
(estimated at about 27,000 for Oblivion, 12,000 for Fallout 3 and 6,000 for Fallout: New Vegas) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for the relevant game is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.
</div>

<div id="install"><h1>Installation &amp; Basic Usage</h1>
<p><b>Note that BOSS does not support Windows 2000 or earlier.</b>
<p>BOSS can be installed for use with TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas or Nehrim - At Fate's Edge (a Total Conversion mod for Oblivion). Installation may either be automated, using the BOSS Installer package, or manually, using the archive package. Either method is simple, and instructions for manual installation are given below.
<ol>
	<li>If you have any of the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities, make sure the <q>Lock Times</q> function is deactivated.
	<li>If upgrading from an earlier version of BOSS, delete all BOSS files and folders in your game's Data folder (including the BOSS folder, BOSS.exe, masterlist.txt, modlist.txt, modlist.old, BOSSlog.txt and any of BOSS's .bat files).  If you have an edited masterlist, make sure to keep a backup so that your edits are not lost. It is recommended that you instead use the user rules functionality to apply changes to the masterlist.
	<li>Extract the BOSS archive you downloaded to your game's installation directory (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q>, <q>fallout new vegas</q> or <q>skyrim</q> depending on your game), so that there is now a BOSS folder alongside the Data folder and the game's executable.
	<li>In the BOSS folder, run the <q>BOSS.exe</q>. This will download the latest masterlist from the Internet and then sort your mods.
</ol>
<p>If you are installing BOSS manually and have more than one of the supported games installed, you should install BOSS separately for each one.
<p>Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. The <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities will automatically import and apply Bash Tag 
suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr> if necessary.
<p>You will need to reorder unrecognised mods by hand using <abbr title="Oblivion Mod Manager">OBMM</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Mod Manager">FOMM</abbr> or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr>.
</div>

<div id="remove"><h1>Uninstallation</h1>
<p>If you installed BOSS using the installer, then use the uninstaller it provides a link to in your Start Menu to uninstall BOSS. If you installed BOSS manually, do the following:
<ol><li>Delete the BOSS folder in your game's installation folder (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q>, <q>fallout new vegas</q> or <q>skyrim</q> depending on your game).</ol>
</div>

<div id="general"><h1>General Usage</h1>
<p>This section gives more information on the parts of BOSS's functionality that users are likely to come into contact with during the course of general usage of BOSS. It gives details on the capabilities of the GUI, information on how to keep BOSS up to date, information on the BOSS Log and its constituent parts, and provides some background information and BOSS-specific notes on the subject of dirty edits and mod cleaning.
<h2 id="gui">The Graphical User Interface</h2>
<p>While the <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> provided by <q>BOSS.exe</q> offers the simplest way to run BOSS using just one click, the <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> provided by <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> provides a way of accessing BOSS's options, settings and more powerful features without having to edit any other files manually.
<p>The CLI and GUI both possess the same core functionality, but differ in how they approach providing it, with the CLI being text-based and the GUI using graphical elements such as buttons, checkboxes and drop-down lists. The GUI is composed of three windows: the Main window, which is the one displayed when the GUI is run; the Settings window; and the User Rules Editor window. Their content shall be explained in turn.

<h4>The Main Window</h4>
<p>The Main window is where BOSS's most commonly-used options are located, along with buttons for running BOSS, editing your User Rules and opening your BOSS Log. The window's menu bar also includes additional options for accessing the Settings window, opening BOSS's ReadMe files, checking for updates and more. The options in the Main window are:

<ul>
	<li>Output Options:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Show BOSS Log On Completion</i>: Open the BOSS Log automatically after BOSS is finished.
		<li><i>Display Plugin Versions</i>: Display in the BOSS Log the version information extracted from plugin descriptions where available.
		<li><i>Display File CRCs</i>: Calculate and display in the BOSS Log the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, and of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins if present.
		<li><i>BOSS Log Format</i>: Specify the format of the BOSS Log generated, and the format that the GUI attempts to open when you click the <q>View BOSS Log</q> button.
	</ul>
	<li>Run Options:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Sort Plugins</i>: The standard mode of operation, sorting your plugins. Its options are:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Update Masterlist</i>: Run the masterlist updater during BOSS's operation.
				<li><i>Perform Trial Run</i>: Simulate BOSS's changes to your load order without actually reordering your mods.
			</ul>
			<li><i>Update Masterlist Only</i>: Updates your masterlist then immediately quits. Its option is:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Game</i>: The game is BOSS installed for. This affects which masterlist BOSS downloads and which master file to look for. 'Autodetect' tells BOSS to decide for itself based on what master file is present.
			</ul>
			<li><i>Undo Changes</i>: Sorts your mods into the order they were in before you last ran BOSS, or the order they were in before the second-last time you ran BOSS, depending on the revert level chosen. Its option is:
			<ul>
				<li><i>Undo Level</i>: Specify how many runs of BOSS are to be undone.
			</ul>
		</ul>
	<li>Buttons:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Edit User Rules</i>: If you have the <q>Use User Rules Editor</q> setting in the Settings window enabled, clicking this will open the User Rules Editor window. Otherwise, it will open your userlist.txt in your default text editor.
		<li><i>Run BOSS</i>: Runs BOSS's primary functionality with the options you have selected.
		<li><i>View BOSS Log</i>: Opens your BOSS Log in the format selected by the <q>BOSS Log Format</q> option.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h4>The Settings Window</h4>
<p>The Settings window is where the rest of BOSS's options are located. These options are grouped into tabs depending on what area of BOSS's behaviour they control. The settings are:
<ul>
	<li>General settings:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Check for BOSS updates on startup</i>: Controls whether or not BOSS checks for updates automatically when it starts up.
		<li><i>Use User Rules Editor</i>: Controls whether the GUI uses the User Rules Editor window to edit user rules or whether it opens the userlist.txt for manual editing.
	</ul>
	<li>Debugging settings:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Debug Outout Verbosity</i>: The verbosity of the debug output. As values increase, so does verbosity, 'Standard (0)' displays only warning and error messages.
		<li><i>Include Source Code References</i>: Add source code references to the debug output.
		<li><i>Log Debug Output</i>: Save the debug output to a <q>BOSSDebugLog.txt</q> text file.
	</ul>
	<li>Internet settings:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Proxy Hostname</i>: Specify the hostname of your proxy, if you use one.
		<li><i>Proxy Port Number</i>: Specify the port number through which your proxy is accessed, if you use one.
	</ul>
	<li>BOSS Log Filters settings:
	<ul>
		<li>These settings control the default states of the BOSS Log filters. If a setting's box is checked, then the filter of the same name in the BOSS Log will be enabled when you open the BOSS Log. See the <q><a href="#bosslog">The BOSS Log</a></q> section below for what each filter does.
	</ul>
	<li>BOSS Log Styling settings:
	<ul>
		<li>These settings control the BOSS Log's CSS styles, used to provide the formatting for the BOSS Log. A knowledge of CSS is expected if you wish to alter these settings. If you do not possess such knowledge, altering these settings is not recommended.
		<li>The CSS selectors are given on the left, and their styling can be edited in the corresponding text boxes on the right.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>Each setting in the GUI corresponds to a command line parameter and/or an ini setting, the details of which can be found in the <q><a href="#cli">Command Line Arguments</a></q> and <q><a href="#customising">Customising How BOSS Works</a></q> sections of this ReadMe respectively.</p>

<h4>The User Rules Editor</h4>
<p>The User Rules Editor can be used to manage your user rules using a graphical interface instead of editing your userlist.txt directly. The information contained within the <q>BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html</q> document is still required to understand user rules. The editor contains the following:
<ul>
	<li>User Rules:
	<ul>
		<li>This section lists your user rules in order. 
		<li>Rules that are currently enabled have their checkboxes checked, whereas disabled rules are unchecked.
		<li>Rules can be moved up or down using the <q>Move Rule Up</q> and <q>Move Rule Down</q> buttons at the bottom of the window.
		<li>When the User Rules Editor is loaded, it will automatically disable any rules adding mods that are already in the masterlist.
	</ul>
	<li>Installed Mods:
	<ul>
		<li>This section lists the plugins found in your Data folder. Plugins are listed in the order that they are loaded.
		<li>All plugins installed are displayed, not just those in your currently active load order.
		<li>The installed mod list may be searched using the search box at the top. Searching looks for matches from the start of plugin filenames, so searching for "xul" would return all plugins with filenames that start with "xul". Searching starts when the "Enter" keyboard key is pressed, it is not performed as you type.
		<li>A plugin may be selected in the list and drag 'n' dropped into a text box in the Rule Creator/Editor to add that plugin to the text box, rather than having to write out the plugin filename by hand.
	</ul>
	<li>Masterlist:
	<ul>
		<li>This section displays the masterlist as a tree list, showing plugins and groups.
		<li>The tree list is by default fully collapsed. Double clicking on a collapsed group (any row without a ".esp" or ".esm" in its name) will expand that group, showing its children. Double clicking an expanded group will collapse it again, hiding its children.
		<li>Selecting a plugin will cause the messages attached to it by the masterlist to be displayed in the Masterlist Mod Messages section.
		<li>The masterlistlist may be searched using the search box at the top. Searching looks for matches from the start of plugin filenames and group names, so searching for "xul" would return all plugins with filenames that start with "xul" and groups with names that start with "xul". Searching starts when the <q>Enter</q> keyboard key is pressed, it is not performed as you type.
	</ul>
	<li>Masterlist Mod Messages:
	<ul>
		<li>This section displays the messages attached to the currently selected mod in the Masterlist section. The messages are displayed as they appear in the masterlist, not as they appear in the BOSS Log. See the <q>BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html</q> for a brief overview of the most common message syntax, and the <q>BOSS Masterlist Syntax.html</q> documentation for the full details.
		<li>The messages cannot be edited here: they must be replaced or added to via a user rule in the Rule Creator.
	</ul>
	<li>Rule Creator/Editor:
	<ul>
		<li>This section is where the user edits or creates user rules. Selecting a rule in the User Rules list will load it into this section.
		<li>The <em>rule object</em> is specified in the first text box. This is the plugin or group that the rule acts upon.
		<li>If the rule object is to be sorted, the object it is sorted relative to must be specified in one of the two text boxes in the Sort Item subsection, depending whether the user is sorting the object relative to another, or inserting a mod into a group.
		<li>Messages for addition or to replace existing messages should be written in the large text box. They must use valid syntax.
		<li>To add the current contents of the Rule Creator/Editor as a new rule, use the <q>Create New Rule</q> button. To save edits to the selected rule in the User Rules list, use the <q>Save Edited Rule</q> button. The User Rules Editor will ask for confirmation before applying the edits.
		<li>To delete the rule selected in the User Rules list, use the <q>Delete Rule</q> button. The User Rules Editor will ask for confirmation before deleting the rule.
		<li>The User Rules Editor will catch most, if not all, syntax errors in created and edited rules and warn the user of the errors encountered. No invalid rules will be saved.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>To save your changes to your userlist and exit, use the <q>Save</q> button. To exit without saving, use the <q>Cancel</q> button.
<p>Plugins and groups may be added to the text boxes in the Rule Creator by dragging and dropping them from the Installed Mods and Masterlist lists on the right of the window. Dropping a plugin or group into a text box currently containing a plugin or group will cause the existing text to be replaced.</p>
<p>The User Rules Editor ignores all silent comments in your userlist.txt, and will strip them from the file if you choose to save your user rules via the editor.
<br />

<h2 id="updates">Keeping BOSS Up-To-Date</h2>
<p>It is important that you keep your BOSS installation updated, not only to benefit from the many frequent updates made to the masterlists, but also to benefit from bug fixes, improvements and new features introduced to new releases of BOSS itself.
<p>Providing there is an Internet connection available when BOSS runs, it will automatically download and apply any updates available for the masterlists. BOSS will also check for new releases and if an update is available, it will ask the user if they want to download and install it. The check for new releases functionality behaves as outlined below:
<ol>
 <li>On launching, it automatically checks for updates to BOSS. If an update is found, it proceeds to the next step. If no update is available, or no Internet connection is present, it will display no message.
 <ul>
  <li>If you run the <q>Check For Updates</q> option from the GUI's Help option, then it will display messages detailing if no update was found or if there were any errors.
 </ul>
 <li>No matter how the update check was started, if an update is available it will prompt the user whether or not to download and install the update. If the user decides not to update, the updater will quit.
 <li>If the user decides to update, then it will begin downloading the file(s) to the BOSS folder, displaying the progress. If using the GUI, the download can be cancelled at any time, in which case any downloaded files will be deleted and the updater will quit. CLI users can cancel the download by quitting BOSS, but no cleanup will take place.
 <ul>
  <li>If you previously installed BOSS using the installer, then the updater shall download the installer for the update, otherwise it will download the files as they appear in the manual archive.
 </ul>
 <li>Once the download is complete, the updater will install the downloaded file(s).
 <ul>
  <li>If the installer was downloaded, it will be launched, and BOSS shall exit. Complete the installation wizard to finish updating.
  <li>If the manual archive files were downloaded, the old BOSS files will be deleted and replaced with the new ones. The updater will be unable to replace the executable that you are running BOSS from, but will instead tell you to rename the downloaded executable, then exit. You must manually rename the file, deleting the old executable, to complete the update.
 </ul>
</ol>
<p>Under certain circumstances the masterlist and program updaters may be unable to function fully. If you have issues using them, see the <q><a href="#special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</a></q> section for alternative methods.

<p>BOSS program updates are also published at the
<a href="http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516">TES Nexus</a>, 
<a href="http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6">Skyrim Nexus</a>,
<a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193">Fallout 3 Nexus</a> and 
<a href="http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999">New Vegas Nexus</a> BOSS pages. For those not using the masterlist updater, the latest masterlist is always on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/">Google Code repository</a>.
<p>Always make sure to use the latest version of BOSS and the latest masterlist.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="bosslog">The BOSS Log</h2>
<p>The BOSS Log is where you will find all of BOSS's outputted information. It can be generated in either HTML format (the default) or as a plain text file with minimal formatting. The HTML format has significant advantages over the plain text format, being considerably easier to read, containing colour-coded messages and a variety of filters to customise what is displayed. However, other than the HTML BOSS Log providing a notification if there has been no change in the recognised mod list since last run, there is no difference in information provided between the two formats.
<p>The HTML BOSS Log has been tested in Mozilla Firefox 4, Google Chrome 11, Opera 11 and Internet Explorer 9. Using earlier browsers may result in parts of the BOSS Log not working or displaying correctly.
<p>The BOSS Log comprises of a number of sections, which are detailed in the table below.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>BOSS Log Section<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>General Messages<td>This section is only displayed if there are any applicable messages to be displayed. Its primary purpose is to allow BOSS to display messages specific to your Oblivion install that are not specific to any one mod. Parser and updater error messages are also displayed in this section.
		<tr><td>Summary<td>This section gives a short summary of BOSS's actions. It breaks down the numbers of plugins installed and messages attached to them and gives the local masterlist version and whether or not it was updated. If the BOSS Log is in the HTML format it will also display a message if your recognised plugin list has not changed since you last ran BOSS.
		<tr><td>Userlist Messages<td>This section is only displayed if BOSS finds any user rules in your userlist. It details the successes or failures of the application of your userlist rules.
		<tr><td>Script Extender And Script Extender Plugins<td>This section is displayed if you have your game's Script Extender installed. It will list the Script Extender and any plugins for it that you have installed, displaying their versions (if given) and their CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled).
		<tr><td>Recognised And Re-ordered Plugins<td>This section comprises the bulk of BOSS's output, listing all your recognised installed plugins and any messages BOSS has attached to them, as well as version information (if given) and the plugin CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled). 
		<tr><td>Restored Load Order<td>This section is only displayed when BOSS is run to undo its changes, and lists your restored load order.
		<tr><td>Unrecognised Plugins<td>This section lists any plugins you have installed that have not been recognised by BOSS. These plugins should be reported in an official BOSS thread with download links to their mods so they can be added to the relevant masterlist.
</table>
<p>BOSS will display the version numbers of any plugins that provide them in their description fields. If a plugin supplies no version number, it cannot be displayed. The version numbers may not reflect the actual version of the mod installed - this could either be due to the mod author forgetting to update the description, or due to a mistake in BOSS's detection. As version numbers are supplied by mod authors in a wide range of formats and BOSS has to detect as many as possible, it occasionally identifies parts of some descriptions as version numbers incorrectly. This is largely unavoidable, but any discrepancies should be reported to the BOSS team in case they can be fixed. When in doubt, check the version number given in a mod's readme. 
<p>It should be noted that the vast majority of BOSS's mod messages are non-conditional, in that they are not displayed in response to your specific install. For example, a message that gives some of the mod's incompatibilities does not know if you have them installed or not, and a message telling you to do something will not know if it has been done.
<p>BOSS's mod messages are one of the most important features BOSS provides, acting as a means of providing users with information that they might otherwise not obtain. It is important for a stable, healthy game that you act on any messages that require action. If you think a message suggests an action that is not necessary, report it to an official BOSS thread.
<p>The HTML BOSS Log includes a few features and a number of filters to customise what is displayed. The majority of these are found in the shaded box near the top of the BOSS Log, and are enabled and disabled via their checkboxes:
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>BOSS Log Filter<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Use Dark Colour Scheme<td>Changes the BOSS Log's colour scheme to a darker variety, more suitable for reading in low light levels and putting less strain on the eyes. Users with vision impairments may find the darker colour scheme easier to read.
		<tr><td>Hide Rule Warnings<td>Hides any warning messages printed in the <q>Userlist Messages</q> section of the BOSS Log.
		<tr><td>Hide Version Numbers<td>Hides the version numbers printed in blue next to those mods that provide them.
		<tr><td>Hide 'Ghosted' Label<td>Hides the 'Ghosted' label printed in grey next to any mods ghosted by Wrye Bash.
		<tr><td>Hide Checksums<td>Hides the checksums of mods and Script Extender plugins printed in brown next to their names.
		<tr><td>Hide Messageless Mods<td>Hides any recognised mods that do not have messages attached to them.
		<tr><td>Hide Ghosted Mods<td>Hides any mods that have been ghosted by Wrye Bash.
		<tr><td>Hide Clean Mods<td>Hides any mods in your load order that don't have messages beginning <q>Contains dirty edits: </q> attached. Note that this doesn't mean the mods hidden are definitely clean, only that BOSS doesn't know they're dirty.
		<tr><td>Hide All Mod Nessages<td>Hides all messages attached to mods.
		<tr><td>Hide Notes<td>Hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Note: </q> prefix.
		<tr><td>Hide Bash Tag Suggestions<td>Hides any Bash Tag suggestions attached to mods.
		<tr><td>Hide Requirements<td>Hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Requires: </q> prefix.
		<tr><td>Hide Incompatibilities<td>Hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Incompatible with: </q> prefix.
		<tr><td>Hide 'Do Not Clean' Messages<td>Hides any messages attached to mods that begin with <q>Contains dirty edits: Do not clean.</q>.
</table>
<p>The number of plugins and messages hidden at any one time are displayed below the filters box in italics. In addition to the above filters, clicking on a section's title will collapse that section, hiding its contents. Clicking the title again will expand the section, making its contents visible again.
<p>It is not possible to hide mod warning or error messages, as these are of a severity where they should almost certainly be acted upon, and not ignored. Be aware that if you hide all a mod's messages and then hide all messageless mods, that mod will be amongst those hidden.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="dirtymods">Dirty Edits, Mod Cleaning &amp; CRCs</h2>
<p>
<p>Dirty edits are often a side-effect of mod creation, and are often due to bugs in the utilities Bethesda has provided to create mods, rather than bad practice by mod authors. Dirty edits can cause a wide range of issues, including incorrect game settings, missing content, broken quests and crashing to desktop. The more dirty edits there are, and the more mods with dirty edits you use, the more likely you are to experience issues.
<p>Thankfully there is a way to remove dirty edits from mods relatively easily, a process known as <i>mod cleaning</i>, using TES4Edit (for Oblivion), FO3Edit (for Fallout 3) or FNVEdit (for Fallout: New Vegas). A detailed set of instructions and information on mod cleaning can be found on the CS Wiki's <a href="http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/TES4Edit_Cleaning_Guide">TES4Edit Cleaning Guide</a> (the page also applies to Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas). <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr> can also scan plugins for dirty edits and return their ITM and UDR counts, though at the time of writing it cannot clean plugins itself.
<p>The problem of dirty edits is largely a problem of ignorance on the part of mod authors and users alike of the problems unclean mods (more widely known as <i>dirty mods</i>) can cause. As such, there are community efforts to raise awareness of dirty edits and cleaning. BOSS plays a key role in these efforts, as it holds the complete list of all known dirty mods, and it uses this information to provide notification messages to users for any dirty mods they have installed.
There are three key pieces of information that are used to accurately describe and identify an unclean mod. They are:
<ul>
	<li><i>ITM Count</i>: ITM (Identical To Master) records are a type of dirty edit where a mod has overwritten something in the game without actually changing anything. If another mod lower in the load order makes an intentional change to that thing, it will have its effect cancelled out by the ITM record, which can cause problems. The ITM count is the number of ITM records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i>UDR Count</i>: Deleting records is a significant cause of crashes and game bugs. UDR (Undeleted and Disabled Reference) records are records that the mod deleted from the game or from another mod that have been corrected safely by undeleting them and disabling them instead, which has the same intended effect without causing issues. The UDR count is the number of deleted reference records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i>CRC</i> or <i>Checksum</i>: A file's CRC is a highly accurate way of identifying it, and is a number calculated from the file's contents. If the contents of a file changes, so will its CRC. BOSS uses CRCs to check if a user's mods are dirty by checking their CRCs against pre-determined CRCs of known dirty mods. This lets BOSS give precise notification messages for any dirty mods it detects. BOSS can calculate the CRCs of all your installed plugins if run from the GUI with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled.
</ul>
<p>However, not all unclean mods have all or any of these pieces of information. For unclean mods whose ITM and UDR counts have not been reported, BOSS cannot give them. For unclean mods whose CRCs have not been reported, BOSS cannot give precise notification and so prints a message whether or not the user has cleaned their mod.
<p>BOSS and the modding communities rely on user contribution of this information to progress. For information on how to contribute, see the <q><a href="#help">Contributions &amp; Help</a></q> section below. If you find that a mod is dirty, you should also report this to the mod's author so that they can fix it.
<p><b>Note:</b> TES4Edit will include a variety of <em>junk records</em> in the ITM count for a plugin, such as new empty cells that are automatically generated by the Construction Set and are almost impossible to remove. These junk records are non-harmful, and BOSS will inform users when a mod contains these to avoid confusion. This is also the source of any discrepancies between the counts produced by TES4Edit and those produced by <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr>. The latter's counts are more technically accurate, but both are acceptable for use.
<p>There is also another type of unnecessary edit, known as a wild edit, that can also cause problems. These edits are neither Itentical To Master edits nor deleted records, so cannot be automatically cleaned. Cleaning must be manually done in TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit. BOSS can still check for plugins with these edits if the CRCs of the plugins with wild edits are known, and it can provide notification of these edits and some information on fixing them if they are reported in an official BOSS thread.

<div id="help"><h1>Contributions &amp; Help</h1>
<p>General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised or unclean plugins, takes place in BOSS's official threads for

<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.
<p>Lists of unrecognised plugins are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>A link to where the description, mod or readme can be found to read or download.
	<li>A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.
</ul>
<p>Lists of unclean plugins are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The CRC(s) of the unlcean ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the uncleaned files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr> or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the <q>CRC checksum for data</q> is the one required.

<div id="advanced"><h1>Advanced Usage</h1>
<p>This section gives information on how to operate BOSS under certain conditions, how to customise its behaviour more fully than previously covered, and provides details for all the BOSS files.

<h2 id="userRules">User Rules</h2>
<p>Users can customise how BOSS handles their plugins through the included User Rules feature. This feature allows you to define the positions of plugins not in the masterlist, and to override the masterlist positions of plugins, as well as edit the output messages of plugins, and more. In addition, this is all done without editing the masterlist.txt, so when you update it using the built-in updater, your changes are not lost. All the information on the User Rules feature can be found in the "BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html" file that accompanies this ReadMe.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="ini">The BOSS.ini</h2>
<p>Users can edit all of BOSS's settings in the BOSS.ini. As this is where BOSS gets its settings from when both running the CLI client and when loading the GUI client, care must be taken to edit it correctly to prevent breaking BOSS's operation. If BOSS is run and it cannot find a BOSS.ini, it will generate a new one with default settings. If BOSS is run with both a BOSS.ini present and command line parameters set, the command line parameters override the settings in BOSS.ini. The ini is split into the following sections:
<h4>BOSS.GeneralSettings</h4>
<p>These settings control miscellaneous areas of BOSS's operation outside of the main sorting functionality.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>bDoStartupUpdateCheck<td><code>true</code><td><code>true</code>, <code>false</code><td>Controls whether or not BOSS's Automatic Updater checks for new releases when BOSS is run.
		<tr><td>bUseUserRulesEditor<td><code>true</code><td><code>true</code>, <code>false</code><td>Controls whether the GUI uses the User Rules Editor window to edit user rules or whether it opens the userlist.txt for manual editing.
</table>
<h4>BOSS.InternetSettings</h4>
<p>These settings control how the masterlist updater and GUI auto-updater connect to the Internet. They are shared by BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe, and can be overriden for the masterlist updater using BOSS's command line parameters. They may also be edited through the GUI. You will probably know if you need to alter them.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>sProxyHostname<td><code>none</code><td><code>none</code>, hostname (eg. <code>proxy.company.com</code>), IP address (eg. <code>192.168.32.4</code>)<td>The hostname for the proxy host used, if a proxy is required to connect to the Internet. <code>none</code> tells BOSS to use no proxy.
		<tr><td>iProxyPort<td><code>0</code><td>Any valid port number.<td>The port used to connect to the proxy host, if a proxy is required to connect to the Internet. <code>0</code> tells BOSS to use no proxy.
		<tr><td>sProxyUsername<td>Default is an empty string.<td>Any string of characters.<td>The username BOSS uses to connect to the Internet through an authenticated proxy. If no username is given, then BOSS assumes that any proxy used is unauthenticated.
		<tr><td>sProxyPassword<td>Default is an empty string.<td>Any string of characters.<td>The password BOSS ues to connect to the Internet through an authenticated proxy. If no password is given, then BOSS assumes that any proxy used is unauthenticated.
</table>
<h4>BOSS.RunOptions</h4>
<p>These settings specify BOSS's run options. They allow you to run BOSS with non-default settings without having to use the command line or the GUI.

<h4>BOSSLog.Filters</h4>
<p>These settings control the default states of the BOSS Log filters. If a filter's default is set to be enabled, then it will be enabled and applied when the BOSS Log is opened. These settings are all boolean switches, so <code>true</code> enables them and <code>false</code> disables them. By default all filters are disabled. See the earlier <q><a href="#bosslog">The BOSS Log</a></q> section for what each filter does.

<h4>BOSSLog.Styles</h4>
<p>These settings control the BOSS Log's CSS styles, used to provide the formatting for the BOSS Log. A knowledge of CSS is expected if you wish to alter these settings. If you do not possess such knowledge, altering these settings is not recommended.</p>

<h2 id="cli">Command Line Arguments</h2>
<p>While the BOSS GUI allows you to specify options using its graphical elements, the CLI uses a combination of the BOSS.ini file and command line arguments to do the same. The syntax for these arguments is:
<p><code>boss [-hVuosndctUl] [-g [game]] [-r [level]] [-v [level]] [-f [type]] [-H [hostname]] [-P [port]]</code>
<p><code>-h [ --help ]</code>
<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments, then exits.
<p><code>-V [ --version ]</code>
<p>Prints the a banner displaying the program name and version number to the command line, then exits.
<p><code>-u [ --update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sorts your plugins. This behaviour is enabled by default, so the command line parameter will have no effect except when the automatic masterlist updating has been disabled in the ini.
<p><code>-U [ --no-update ]</code>
<p>Inhibits the default automatic masterlist updater, preventing it from running. Must not be used alongside --update,-u.
<p><code>-o [ --only-update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then does <b>not</b> sort your plugins.
<p><code>-g [ --game ] [ game ]</code>
<p>Overrides game autodetection. The valid values of the argument are: <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code>, <code>FalloutNV</code> and <code>Skyrim</code>. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS will fail before any plugins are sorted, so this should be used in conjunction with -o.
<p><code>-s [ --silent ]</code>
<p>Stops BOSS from automatically opening up the BOSS Log in your web browser (or text editor, depending on format chosen) after it has finished running.
<p><code>-c [ --crc-display ]</code>
<p>Calculates the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder and displays them in your BOSS Log alongside the plugin names. The version numbers and CRCs of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins will also be displayed in your BOSS Log.
<p><code>-n [ --no-version-parse ]</code>
<p>Disables the parsing of each plugin's description to extract the author's version information, so it is not printed alongside the other data in the BOSS Log. This can be used if the version 
parsing is not working properly for some of your plugins and you wish to remove the version notes.
<p><code>-f [ --format ] [ type ]</code>
<p>Allows the selection of the BOSS Log format. Valid argument values are: <code>html</code> and <code>text</code>. <code>html</code> is the default output format. The <code>text</code> value will print the BOSS Log as plain text into a 'BOSSlog.txt' file, similar to the BOSS Log in BOSS v1.5 and below.
<p><code>-t [ --trial-run ]</code>
<p>BOSS runs, but no plugins are redated, so your load order is not changed. The BOSS Log still displays the order BOSS would have placed them in, so it is useful for checking what would happen if you ran BOSS on your load order without having to then undo BOSS's changes.
<p><code>-r [ --revert ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Revert to a previous load order. This parameter optionally accepts values of <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>, indicating how many undo steps to apply. If no option is specified, it defaults to <code>1</code>. A value of <code>1</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
A value of <code>2</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.
<p><code>-v [ --verbose ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Specify the verbosity level (<code>0</code> to <code>3</code>) of the debugging output. <code>0</code> is the default, showing only warning and error messages. <code>1</code> (warning, error and informational messages) is implied if this option is specified without an argument. Higher values increase the verbosity further.
<p><code>-d [ --debug-with-source ]</code>
<p>Adds source file references (filenames and line numbers) to debugging statements.
<p><code>-l [ log-debug ]</code>
<p>Logs the debug output to the <q>BOSSDebugLog.txt</q> file instead of the command line.
<p><code>-H [ --proxy-host ] [ hostname ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy hostname for the masterlist updater. The hostname may be an actual hostname (eg. <code>proxy.company.com</code>), an IP address (eg. <code>192.168.32.4</code>) or <code>none</code>. <code>none</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.
<p><code>-P [ --proxy-port ] [ port ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy port number for the masterlist updater. The port number may be any valid port number. <code>0</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</h2>
<p>The vast majority of users will be able to use BOSS's masterlist updater and the auto-updater with no problems. However, some users' circumstances may be such that the standard method will not work. This section provides instructions for those users.
<p>The most common special circumstance is when the computer the user has BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet. Merely transferring <q>BOSS.exe</q> to another computer and running it is not sufficient, as by default BOSS tries to autodetect the game it is installed for, and if there is no game present it will exit with an error. In this circumstance, the following instructions should be used to obtain masterlist updates:
<ol>
	<li>Copy <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> from your BOSS folder to the computer with an Internet connection.
	<li>Run the BOSS GUI.exe and select the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> option. For the <q>Game</q> option below, select your game from the drop-down list. This will tell BOSS which game's masterlist to download.
	<li>If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, also record your proxy settings in the relevant part of the GUI's <q>Settings</q> window.
	<li>Select <q>Run BOSS</q>. Your masterlist will be downloaded into the same folder as your <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>. Some other BOSS files will also be created, you can safely delete these.
</ol>
<p>A rarer circumstance is when the user connects to the Internet using a proxy. This is most common in enterprise environments, and such users will generally know if they use a proxy. If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you must either record your proxy settings in the relevant part of the GUI's <q>Settings</q> window or manually enter your proxy settings into your <q>BOSS.ini</q> settings file. See the <q><a href="#customising">Customising How BOSS Works</a></q> section above for details on the expected settings. BOSS does not support the use of authenticated proxies at this time.
<p>If your circumstances are such that the computer you have BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet, or if you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, it is recommended that you avoid using the auto-updater, simply because it is easier in these circumstances to download new releases through your web browser.
<p>There may also be other special cases which cause problems for BOSS's updaters that the BOSS team is unaware of. If you are having issues using the updaters, contact the BOSS team for support.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="linux">Running BOSS Under Linux</h2>
<p>It is possible to run BOSS on Linux through the Wine compatibility layer, though no official support for doing so is given. Installation and usage is as on Windows. 
It is also possible to compile BOSS natively for Linux, and makefiles are provided, although there is again no official support for doing so. Native Linux builds are case-sensitive in their recognition of plugins in the masterlist, and while plugins are generally added with the correct case, occasionally a plugin might have the incorrect case which would cause problems for a user with a native Linux build.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="files">BOSS Changes and Files</h2>
<p>The only changes BOSS makes to your game install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, and create a few files in your BOSS folder. Your game's master file (Oblivion.esm, Nehrim.esm, Fallout3.esm, FalloutNV.esm or Skyrim.esm) is never altered, and all dates are derived from it.
<p>BOSS stores all its files in the BOSS folder. BOSS's files are detailed in the table below.

<div id="troubleshooting"><h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Although BOSS is simple to use, it has grown to become a relatively complex application. As such, there are some circumstances under which BOSS may not be able to run correctly, due to a variety of possible reasons. In such cases, an error message detailing the problem should be provided. If the program unexpectedly crashes, or you experience 
a problem for which no error message is given, please report the crash or problem to an official BOSS thread (linked to in the <q><a href="#links">Quick Links</a></q> section below), so that we may fix it.
<p>If the information below does not help you to solve any problems you are experiencing, please seek further support in one of the official BOSS threads.</p>
<h2 id="general-issues">General Problems</h2>
<p>There are a few general reasons why BOSS may fail to function correctly. Check if any of the symptoms listed below fit your issue.
<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> No change in load order.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr>'s <q>Lock Times</q> load order locking feature is enabled.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Disable <q>Lock Times</q> before running BOSS. Wrye Bash v277 or later and corresponding versions of Wrye Flash and Wrye Flash NV do this for you, and <q>Lock Times</q> is then re-activated after BOSS has run.
	</ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not change/update the BOSS Log and/or modlists correctly.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> The BOSS Log and/or modlists are read-only, or the BOSS folder is read-only.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure that the BOSS folder and any files in it are not read-only.
	</ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not recognise the plugins in my userlist correctly, and/or replaces some of the letters in their names with question marks.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Your userlist is not encoded in UTF-8.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Save your userlist in the UTF-8 encoding.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> You had plugins in your userlist with non-Latin letters in their names, and saved your userlist in a non-UTF8 encoding before saving it in UTF-8.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Rewrite the filenames in your userlist, copy/pasting them from the files themselves to ensure they are correct.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> Some plugins have the wrong or no version number given in the BOSS Log.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> This occurs because BOSS looks for the version number in the plugin's description field. If the plugin author has forgotten to update the version number there or not provided one, an incorrect or no version number will be displayed.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> No solution, other than the plugin author including a correct version number in the plugin's description field for a later release.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h2 id="permissions">File Permissions</h2>
<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:
<ol>
	<li>Install the game outside the <q>Program Files</q> (or <q>Program Files (x86)</q> if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.
	<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.
	<li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.
	<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the <q>BOSS.exe</q> and <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>, and select <q>Run as administrator</q>.
</ol>
<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.
	<li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.
	<li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.
	<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.
	<li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.
</ol>
<br />

<h2 id="international">International Character Support</h2>
<p>BOSS provides support for sorting plugins containing characters from any language via the Unicode character encoding, specifically UTF-8. All BOSS's files are encoded in UTF-8 by default. However, if you created your userlist.txt before BOSS automatically created one, you will probably need to convert it to the UTF-8 encoding, as it is not Notepad's default encoding. Below are some instructions for converting a file's encoding to UTF-8:
<ul>
	<li>Using Notepad:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
	<li>Using Notepad++:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad++.
			<li>Open the <q>Encoding</q> menu, then select <q>Convert to UTF-8</q>.
			<li>Save the file as normal.
		</ol>
</ul>
<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="errors">Error Messages</h2>
<p>If BOSS can detect a specific reason for being unable to function correctly, it will print an error message detailing the problem. BOSS's error messages are listed below, along with details of the issues and possible solutions.
<ul class="errorMessages">
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>Oblivion.esm and Nehrim.esm both detected!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> You have installed Nehrim incorrectly.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Uninstall Nehrim, read its Readme, then re-install it correctly.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>No game master .esm file found!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS is not being run in the correct folder.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Move the BOSS folder containing all of BOSS's files into your game's installation folder, which is the one that contains the Data folder.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Your master .ESM file is deactivated and ghosted by <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash, Wrye Flash NV or Wrye Smash">Wrye *ash</abbr>.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-activate your master .ESM file.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be read!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If <code>filename</code> is the masterlist, ensure that the masterlist updater is enabled and run BOSS again to download the masterlist to the correct location.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure <code>filename</code> exists, and that you have read permissions for the file and its parent folders.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be written to!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to <code>filename</code> if it exists.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <q><a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a></q> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" is not encoded in valid UTF-8!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> If <code>filename</code> is "userlist.txt", BOSS has detected that your userlist.txt is saved using the wrong encoding, and is unable to read it.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save the file given in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. If you are unsure on how to do so, follow these instructions:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
		<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.
		
		<li><b>Issue:</b> If <code>filename</code> is not "userlist.txt", BOSS is not functioning correctly.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save <code>filename</code> in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. Report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be found!</i>

<p>While the GPL license allows anyone to make derivative works of BOSS, the BOSS Development Team would like to encourage those thinking of doing so to first discuss their reasoning for such an endevour with the team. It may be that what the derivative work would do differently from BOSS itself is already planned for a future version of BOSS or would be happily integrated into BOSS by the Team, thus avoiding any extra effort by others.
<p>The BOSS Team would also like to appeal to the community to avoid the distribution and development of alternative masterlists, as this would only hamper the community effort to create one universally-optimised load order for all plugins available for download. Any issues with a masterlist are best brought to the attention of the BOSS Team so that we may remedy them ourselves.

<div id="history"><h1>Version History</h1>
<p>The changelogs for each release of BOSS are listed below. The masterlists are updated far too frequently for their changes to be concisely recorded here, but a full history of changes to them may be viewed by browsing the Google Code repository.
<p><b>Version 1.9.1</b> - <i> 2011</i>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed: Mods in the last group of a masterlist being unrecognised when one or more user rules were enabled.
	<li>Changed: Copyright license is now GNU General Public License v3.0 for everything but the documentation, and GNU Free Documentation License v1.3 for the documentation.
	<li>Changed: Updated version of libcurl used to 7.23.1 from 7.22.0.
</ul>
<p><b>Version 1.9</b> - <i>13 November 2011</i>
<ul>
	<li>Changed: Major refactoring of BOSS code into a common library, a Command Line Interface and a Graphical User Interface.
	<li>Common Library:
	<ul>
		<li>Removed: Checking for changes to the recognised mod list since last run for the plain text BOSS Log, as this did not work correctly and is not feasible to fix.
		<li>Removed: Command line parameter <code>-T [ --proxy-type ] [ type ]</code> and BOSS.ini setting <code>sProxyType</code> Internet proxy type specification options. Proxy type is now automatically determined.
		<li>Fixed: A bug where if a plugin filename started with "SET" or "GLOBAL" (or case variations) then BOSS would incorrectly classify it as a variable or global message line and so result in syntax errors.
		<li>Fixed: User Rules which failed to add a plugin into the beginning or end of a group still incremented the number of recognised plugins as if the rule application had succeeded.
		<li>Fixed: Userlist rules which reference plugins that are not installed now have warning messages reported instead of error messages.
		<li>Fixed: Masterlist conditions now detect ghosted mods correctly.
		<li>Fixed: The online Fallout: New Vegas masterlist's revision being checked instead of the online Fallout 3 masterlist's revision when updating the Fallout 3 masterlist.
		<li>Fixed: The <q>Hide Messageless Mods</q> BOSS Log filter not acting when another filter resulted in all a mod's messages being hidden.
		<li>Fixed: The last group of mods in a masterlist being unrecognised.
		<li>Changed: More robust error handling.
		<li>Changed: User rules can now only use up to one sort line and/or one REPLACE message line per rule, and cannot sort mods/groups relative to themselves.

		<li>Changed: Content and slight formatting changes to BOSS Log:

			<li>The number of plugins and messages hidden at any one time is displayed below the filters box in italics.
			<li>The Script Extender And Script Extender Plugins section is now always displayed, with CRCs only being calculated if the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option is set.

			<li>Added <q>bLogDebugOutput</q> setting to <q>BOSS.RunOptions</q> to control the logging of debugging output.
			<li>Added <q>bUseUserRulesEditor</q> setting to <q>BOSS.GeneralSettings</q> to control how to the GUI chooses to edit user rules.
