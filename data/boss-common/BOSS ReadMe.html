	</ul>
	<p>Better Oblivion Sorting Software (BOSS) will re-order your mods to their correct positions, putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.</p>
	<p>BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods such as FCOM, MMM and FOOK, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there 
	(estimated at about 30,000 for Oblivion, and about 11,000 for Fallout 3) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for the relevant game is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.</p>
	</div>
	<br /><br />
	
	<div id="install"><span>Installation &amp; Basic Usage</span>
	<p>BOSS can be installed for use with Oblivion, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas or Nehrim - At Fate's Edge (a Total Conversion mod for Oblivion). Installation may either be automated, using the BOSS Installer package, or manually, using the archive package. Either method is simple, and instructions for manual installation are given below.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you have Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV, make sure the <q>Lock Times</q> function is deactivated.</li>
		<li>If upgrading from an earlier version of BOSS, delete all BOSS files and folders in your game's Data folder (including the BOSS folder, BOSS.exe, masterlist.txt, modlist.txt, modlist.old, BOSSlog.txt and any of BOSS's .bat files).  If you have an edited masterlist, make sure to keep a backup so that your edits are not lost.</li>
		<li>Extract the BOSS archive you downloaded to your game's installation directory (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q> or <q>fallout new vegas</q> depending on your game), so that there is now a BOSS folder alongside the Data folder and the game's executable.</li>
		<li>In the BOSS folder, run the <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> and check the box for <q>Update Masterlist</q> under the <q>Sort Mods</q> run option, then click the <q>Run BOSS</q> button. This will download the latest masterlist from the Internet and then sort your mods.</li>
		<li>When running BOSS, you may run BOSS directly from the BOSS.exe to simply sort your mods, or you can use the GUI to choose how BOSS runs. Remember to update the masterlist via the GUI options regularly.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you are installing BOSS manually and have more than one of the supported games installed, you should install BOSS separately for each one.</p>
	<p>Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. Wrye Bash/Flash will automatically import and apply Bash Tag 
	suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in Wrye Bash/Flash if necessary.</p>
	<p>You will need to reorder "unknown" mods by hand using <acronym title="Oblivion Mod Manager">OBMM</acronym>/<acronym title="Fallout Mod Manager">FOMM</acronym> or Wrye Bash/Flash.</p>
	<p>You can update your masterlist to the latest version by running the GUI and either selecting the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> run option or checking the <q>Update Masterlist</q> box under the <q>Sort Mods</q> run option. This will replace your copy with the latest available online, and then run BOSS as normal using the updated masterlist. <b>If you 
	have an edited masterlist, using this updater will cause you to lose all your edits.</b></p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="remove"><span>Uninstallation</span>
	<p>Delete the BOSS folder in your game's installation folder (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q> or <q>fallout new vegas</q> depending on your game).</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="advanced"><span>General &amp; Advanced Usage</span><br /><br />
	<span class="subtitle">The Graphical User Interface</span>
	<p>BOSS comes with a <acronym title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</acronym> that provides easy access to all of BOSS's functions and features. With it, you can:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Run BOSS in one of three modes: the first sorts your mods, the second only updates your masterlist, and the third lets you undo the changes BOSS makes to your load order, either one step back or two.</li>
		<li>Specify BOSS's run options using a set of butttons, checkboxes and lists quickly and easily, avoiding the command line.</li>
		<li>Open your BOSSlog for viewing and edit your userlist without having to navigate to them through Explorer.</li>
		<li>View BOSS's main and User Rules ReadMes through handy Help menu shortcuts.</li>
		<li>Check for updates to BOSS and your masterlist.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>The GUI is also aware of what version of BOSS you are running, and will disable (grey out) any options that are not supported by the version of BOSS you have installed in order to minimise confusion. All the GUI's options should be self-explanatory, 
	but if you have issues understanding what they do, each setting has a corresponding command line parameter, which all have detailed descriptions in the <a href="#details">Further Details</a> section below.</p>
	<p>Note that the BOSSlog format selection applies to both the format of the BOSSlog that will be generated when BOSS is run and the format that the GUI will try to open when you select "View BOSSlog".</p><br />
	
	<span class="subtitle">The BOSS Log</span>
	<p>The BOSSlog is where you will find all of BOSS's outputted information. It can be generated in either HTML format (the default) or as a plain text file with minimal formatting. The HTML format has significant advantages over the plain text format, being considerably easier to read, containing colour-coded messages and a variety of filters to customise what is displayed. Both formats, however, contain the same information.</p>
	<p>The HTML BOSSlog has been tested in Mozilla Firefox 4, Google Chrome 11, Opera 11 and Internet Explorer 9. Using earlier browsers may result in parts of the BOSSlog not working or displaying correctly.</p>
	<p>The BOSSlog comprises of a number of sections, them being:</p>
	<ol>
		<li><i>Masterlist Update</i>: This section is only displayed if you have run BOSS with the "Update Masterlist" or "Update Masterlist Only" options enabled, and details the success or failure of the update.</li>
		<li><i>General Messages</i>: This section is only displayed if there are any applicable messages to be displayed. Its primary purpose is to allow BOSS to display messages specific to your Oblivion install that are not specific to any one mod, for example if an update to BOSS or OBSE is available.</li>
		<li><i>Userlist Messages</i>: This section is only displayed if BOSS finds a userlist.txt in your BOSS folder. In this section the successes or failures of the application of your userlist rules will be detailed.</li>
		<li><i>Script Extender And Script Extender Plugins Checksums</i>: This section is displayed when BOSS is run with the "Enable File CRC Display" option enabled and you have your game's Script Extender installed. It will list the Script Extender and any plugins you have installed, displaying their versions if given and their CRCs.</li>
		<li><i>Recognised And Re-ordered Plugins</i> or <i>Restored Load Order</i>: This section comprises the bulk of BOSS's output, listing all your recognised installed plugins and any messages BOSS has attached to them, as well as version information (if given) and the plugin CRCs (if run with "Enable File CRC Display" enabled). When BOSS is run to undo its changes, this section will list your restored load order.</li>
		<li><i>Unrecognised Plugins</i>: This section lists any plugins you have installed that have not been recognised by BOSS. These plugins should be reported in an official BOSS thread with download links to their mods so they can be added to the masterlist.</li>
		<li><i>Plugin Numbers</i>: This small section gives a few numbers relating to the mods you have installed.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>BOSS will display the version numbers of any plugins that provide version information in their description fields. If a plugin does not supply any version information, no version number will be displayed for it. The version number of plugins may occasionally not match the version of the mod installed, this is due to the mod author forgetting to update the plugin's version information. When in doubt, check the version number given in a mod's readme.</p>
	<p>It should be noted that the vast majority of BOSS's mod messages are non-conditional, in that they are not displayed in response to your specific install. For example, a message that gives some of the mod's incompatibilities does not know if you have them installed or not, and a message telling you to do something will not know if it has been done.</p>
	<p>BOSS's mod messages are the second most important function BOSS provides, acting as a means of providing users with information that they might otherwise not obtain. It is important for a stable, healthy game that you act on any messages that require action. If you think a message suggests an action that is not necessary, report it to an official BOSS thread.</p>
	<p>The HTML BOSSlog includes a few features and a number of filters to customise what is displayed. The majority of these are found in the shaded box near the top of the BOSSlog, and are enabled and disabled via their checkboxes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><i>Collapsible Sections</i>: This does not have a checkbox. Instead, clicking on a section's header will collapse that section, hiding its contents. Clicking the header again will expand the section, making its contents visible again.</li>
		<li><i>Use Dark Colour Scheme</i>: This will change the BOSSlog's colour scheme to a darker variety, more suitable for reading in low light levels and putting less strain on the eyes. Users with vision impairments may find the darker colour scheme easier to read.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Version Numbers</i>: This will hide the version numbers printed in blue next to those mods that provide them.</li>
		<li><i>Hide 'Ghosted' Label</i>: This will hide the 'Ghosted' printed in grey next to any mods ghosted by Wrye Bash.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Checksums</i>: This will hide the checksums of mods and Script Extender plugins printed in brown next to their names.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Messageless Mods</i>: This will hide any recognised mods that do not have messages attached to them.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Ghosted Mods</i>: This will hide any mods that have been ghosted by Wrye Bash.</li>
		<li><i>Hide All Mod Nessages</i>: This hides all the messages attached to all recognised mods.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Notes</i>: This hides any messages attached to mods that have the "Note: " prefix.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Bash Tag Suggestions</i>: This hides any Bash Tag suggestions attached to mods.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Requirements</i>: This hides any messages attached to mods that have the "Requires: " prefix.</li>
		<li><i>Hide Incompatibilities</i>: This hides any messages attached to mods that have the "Incompatible with: " prefix.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is not possible to hide warning or error messages, as these are of a severity where they should almost certainly be acted upon, and not ignored. If you hide all a mod's messages using the filters and then enable the "Hide message-less mods" filter, that mod will not be hidden, as it still has messages even if they are not currently visible.</p>
	</p><br />
	
	
	<span class="subtitle">Customising How BOSS Works</span>
	<p>Users can customise how BOSS works through the included User Rules feature. This feature allows you to define the positions of mods not in the masterlist, and to override the masterlist positions of mods,
	as well as edit the output messages of mods, and more. In addition, this is all done without editing the masterlist.txt, so when you update it using the built-in updater, your changes are not lost. All the information on the User Rules feature can be found in the "BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html" file.
	</p><br />
	
	<span class="subtitle">Running BOSS Under Linux</span>
	<p>It is possible to run BOSS on Linux through the Wine compatibility layer, though no official support for doing so is given. Installation and usage is as on Windows. 
	It is also possible to compile BOSS natively for Linux, and makefiles are provided, although there is again no official support for doing so. Native Linux builds are case-sensitive in their recognising of mods in the masterlist, and while mods are generally added with the correct case, occasionally a mod might have the incorrect case which would cause problems for a user with a native Linux build.</p>

	<div id="details"><span>Further Details</span><br />
	<br /><span class="subtitle">Command Line Arguments</span>
	<p>The BOSS GUI acts as a frontend to BOSS, and its output and run options correspond to BOSS's command line arguments. The syntax for these arguments is:</p>
	<div>
	<p><code>boss [-hVuosndc] [-g [game]] [-r [level]] [-v [level]] [-f [type]]</code></p>
	<p><code>-h [ --help ]</code></p>
	<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments, then exits.</p>
	<p><code>-V [ --version ]</code></p>
	<p>Prints the a banner displaying the program name and version number to the command line, then exits.</p>
	<p><code>-u [ --update ]</code></p>
	<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sorts your mods. Since this replaces your current 
	masterlist, don't run this if you have an edited copy and wish to keep the changes.</p>
	<p><code>-o [ --only-update ]</code></p>
	<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then does <b>not</b> sort your mods. Since this replaces your current 
	masterlist, don't run this if you have an edited copy and wish to keep the changes.</p>
	<p><code>-g [ --game ] [ game ]</code></p>
	<p>Overrides game autodetection. The valid values of the argument are: 'Oblivion', 'Nehrim', 'Fallout3', and 'FalloutNV'. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS will fail before any mods are sorted, so this should be used in conjunction with -o.</p>
	<p><code>-s [ --silent ]</code></p>
	<p>Stops BOSS from automatically opening up the BOSSlog in your web browser (or text editor, depending on format chosen) after it has finished running.</p>
	<p><code>-n [ --no-version-parse ]</code></p>
	<p>Disables the parsing of each mod's description to extract the author's version information, so it is not printed alongside the other data in the BOSSlog. This can be used if the version 
	parsing is not working properly for some of your mods and you wish to remove the version notes.</p>
	<p><code>-r [ --revert ] [ level ]</code></p>
	<p>Revert to a previous load order. This parameter optionally accepts values of 1 or 2, indicating how many undo steps to apply. If no option is specified, it defaults to 1. A value of 1 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
	A value of 2 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.</p>
	<p><code>-v [ --verbose ] [ level ]</code></p>
	<p>Specify verbosity level (0-3). 0 is the default, showing only warning and error messages. 1 (warning, error and informational messages) is implied if this option is specified without an argument. Higher values increase the verbosity further.</p>
	<p><code>-d [ --debug ]</code></p>
	<p>Adds source file references (filenames and line numbers) to logging statements.</p>
	<p><code>-c [ --crc-display ]</code></p>
	<p>Calculates the <acronym title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</acronym> of all the plugins in your Data folder and displays them in your BOSSlog alongside the plugin names. The version numbers and CRCs of <acronym title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</acronym>/<acronym title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</acronym>/<acronym title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</acronym> and its installed plugins will also be displayed in your BOSSlog.</p>
	<p><code>-f [ --format ] [ type ]</code></p>
	<p>Allows the selection of the BOSSlog format. Valid argument values are: 'html' and 'text'. 'html' is the default output format. The 'text' value will print the BOSSlog as plain text into a 'BOSSlog.txt' file, similar to the BOSSlog in BOSS v1.5 and below.</p>
	</div><br />
	
	<span class="subtitle">BOSS Changes and Files</span>
	<p>The only changes BOSS makes to your game install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, and create a few text files in your BOSS folder. Your game's master file (Oblivion.esm, Fallout3.esm, Nehrim.esm or FalloutNV.esm) 
	is never touched, and all dates are derived from it.</p>
	<div>BOSS's files are all found in the BOSS folder, and they are:
	<ul>
		<li><i>BOSSlog.html</i> - This log is where the output that BOSS generates and displays once the program ends is stored. It is replaced every time you run BOSS. You can view it in any web browser.</li>
		<li><i>BOSSlog.txt</i> - This file is the same as the above  BOSSlog.html, but the information is given in plaintext instead of with HTML formatting. It is only created if you specify the 'text' format when running BOSS. You can view it in any text editor.</li>
		<li><i>masterlist.txt</i> - This is the master list of mods that BOSS recognises, listing them in order and which includes notes attached to them. It is the most frequently updated component of BOSS, receiving updates almost every day.</li>
		<li><i>modlist.txt</i> - This file contains the list of your mods in the order they were before you last ran BOSS, which can be used to undo changes to your load order.</li>
		<li><i>modlist.old</i> - This file contains the contents of your modlist.txt before you last ran BOSS, providing a second level of undo for load order changes.</li>
		<li><i>userlist.txt</i> - This file contains your custom rules to be implemented by the User Rules feature.</li>
	</ul>

	<div id="troubleshooting"><span>Troubleshooting</span><br /><br />
	<p>In some circumstances BOSS may not be able to run properly, due to a variety of possible reasons. In such cases, an error message detailing the problem should be provided. If the program unexpectedly crashes, or you experience 
	a problem for which no error message is given, please report the crash or problem to an official BOSS thread (linked to in the <em>Quick Links</em> section below), so that we may fix it.</p>
	<p>If the information below does not help you to solve any problems you are experiencing, please seek further support in one of the official BOSS threads.</p>
	<span class="subtitle">General Problems</span>
	<p>There are a few general reasons why BOSS may fail to function correctly. Check if any of the symptoms listed below fit your issue.</p>
	
	<ul>
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> No change in load order.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Wrye Bash's <q>Lock Times</q> load order locking feature is enabled.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Disable <q>Lock Times</q> before running BOSS. If you are using Wrye Bash v277 or later and running BOSS from Wrye Bash, this is done for you, and <q>Lock Times</q> is then re-activated after BOSS has run.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not change/update the BOSSlog and/or modlists correctly.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> The BOSSlog and/or modlists are read-only, or the BOSS folder is read-only.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure that the BOSS folder and any files in it are not read-only.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not recognise the mods in my userlist correctly, and/or replaces some of the letters in their names with question marks.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Your userlist is not encoded in UTF-8.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Save your userlist in the UTF-8 encoding.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> You had mods in your userlist with non-Latin letters in their names, and saved your userlist in a non-UTF8 encoding before saving it in UTF-8.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Rewrite the filenames in your userlist, copy/pasting them from the files themselves to ensure they are correct.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> Some mods have the wrong or no version number given in the BOSSlog.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> This occurs because BOSS looks for the version number in the plugin's description field. If the mod author has forgotten to update the version number there or not provided one, an incorrect or no version number will be displayed.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> No solution, other than the mod author including a correct version number in the plugin's description field for a later release.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle">File Permissions</span>
	<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Install the game outside the <q>Program Files</q> (or <q>Program Files (x86)</q> if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.</li>
		<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.</li>
		<li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.</li>
		<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the BOSS.exe, and select <q>Run as administrator</q>.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.</li>
		<li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.</li>
		<li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.</li>
		<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.</li>
		<li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.</li>
	</ol>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle">International Character Support</span>
	<p>BOSS provides support for sorting mods containing characters from any language via the Unicode character encoding, specifically UTF-8. If your userlist contains any non-English characters, it <b>must</b>
	be encoded in UTF-8 for BOSS to read it correctly. <b>This is not Notepad's default encoding!</b> If you need to convert a file's encoding, here are some instructions:</p>
    <ul>
		<li>Using Notepad:<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the file in Notepad.</li>
				<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.</li>
				<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.</li>
				<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>Using Notepad++:<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
			<ol>
				<li>Open the file in Notepad++.</li>
				<li>Open the <q>Encoding</q> menu, then select <q>Convert to UTF-8</q>.</li>
				<li>Save the file as normal.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.</p>
	<br />
	
	<span class="subtitle">Error Messages</span>
	<p>If BOSS can detect a specific reason for being unable to function correctly, it will print an error message detailing the problem. BOSS's error messages are listed below, along with details of the issues and possible solutions. The list does not include any messages related to user rule application.</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Message:</b> Error: file '<em>filename</em>' could not be accessed for writing.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the given file if it exists.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />	
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: Master .ESM file not found!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS is not being run in the correct folder.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Move the BOSS folder containing all of BOSS's files into your game's installation folder, which is the one that contains the Data folder.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Your master .ESM file is deactivated and ghosted by Wrye Bash/Flash.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-activate your master .ESM file.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Error: Masterlist update failed.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Masterlist cannot be opened.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that your BOSS folder (and masterlist.txt if it exists) is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Curl error.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> There was a problem in getting information from the Internet. Depending on the error given, make sure your Internet connection is working correctly, or try again later. If you use a proxy make sure that the proxy service is running.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Cannot find online masterlist revision number.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> The layout of the Google Code page has changed, and a program update will be required to take account of this. Please report this issue in the official forum thread.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: <em>filename</em> cannot be read!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> <em>filename</em> does not exist, is in the wrong place, or is corrupt in some way.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> If <em>filename</em> is your game's master .ESM file and this error is displayed, it means that your master .ESM file exists, but its date cannot be read. This can only take place under very specialised circumstances, such as corruption of your master .ESM file, and probably means you will have to seek expert help.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> If <em>filename</em> is 'masterlist.txt' and this error is displayed, make sure that your masterlist.txt is in your BOSS folder, or use the masterlist updater to download a new masterlist to the correct place.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Error: Could not change the date of "<em>filename</em>", make sure you have write access to it.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the plugin given.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Check that the plugin is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: "<em>filename</em>" is not encoded in valid UTF-8. Please save the file using the UTF-8 encoding.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> If <em>filename</em> is 'userlist.txt', BOSS has detected that your userlist.txt is saved using the wrong encoding, and is unable to read it.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save the file given in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. If you are unsure on how to do so, follow these instructions:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>Open the file in Notepad.</li>
					<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.</li>
					<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.</li>
					<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.</li>
				</ol>
				<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.</p>
