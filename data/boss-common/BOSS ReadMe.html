<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>

<p>BOSS is designed to assist in the usage of mods, helping mod users avoid serious conflicts by setting their plugins in their optimal load order. It is not a complete solution to load order issues, as there are far more mods available than BOSS knows about. To properly place mod plugins that BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of load ordering is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.
<p>Although BOSS doesn't recognise every plugin available, it does recognise over 22,100 plugins across the 6 games it supports, with the breakdown being roughly:
<ul>
	<li>Over 13,300 TES IV: Oblivion plugins.
	<li>Over 3,500 TES V: Skyrim plugins.
	<li>Over 3,100 Fallout 3 plugins.
	<li>Over 3,100 Fallout: New Vegas plugins.
	<li>Over 180 Nehrim - At Fate's Edge plugins.
</ul>
<p>Although BOSS technically supports TES III: Morrowind, no mod plugins are recognised and no further support is planned. Morrowind users looking for an automated load order manager should consider using <a href="http://code.google.com/p/mlox/">mlox</a> instead.
<p>As well as sorting a large number of plugins, BOSS also provides over 10,000 plugin-specific messages, including usage notes, requirements, incompatibilities, warnings on bugs and installation mistake notifications. BOSS also sorts plugins that are ghosted by the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities, and provides Bash Tag suggestions for use with them.
<p>BOSS is also highly customisable, with a feature that allows users to set where plugins should load and what messages should be displayed for them, not to mention a host of filters and display options available in its HTML-format output file, which is itself one of two output formats supported.
<p>Community contributions of unrecognised plugins and other information and feedback are vital to BOSS's upkeep, so make sure to let us know what you know. See the <a href="#help">Contributions &amp; Help</a> section for details.
<p>Finally, if you're developing a modding utility yourself and find yourself dealing with load orders, the BOSS API gives access to almost all of BOSS's functionality, plus more general load order and active status management functionality that works uniformly across all supported games. See the <a href="BOSS%20API%20Readme.html">BOSS API Readme</a> for more information on that.


<h2 id="install">Installation</h2>
<p><b>BOSS does not support Windows 2000 or earlier.</b>
<p>The simplest way to install BOSS is to use the installer. However, the instructions below are provided if a manual install method is preferred.
<ol>
	<li>If updating from an earlier version of BOSS, uninstall the existing BOSS install before continuing. Any userlists you have should be moved to a temporary location while you install the BOSS update.
	<li>Extract the <q>BOSS</q> folder the downloaded archive contains to a location of your choice. Make sure that you have the appropriate file permissions for the directory you choose. See the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section for more information. Note that if you install the BOSS folder to the same location as a supported game's executable, BOSS will only run for that game by default, and will not ask you to choose which game it should run for, even if you have other supported games installed.
	<li>If any of the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities are installed, make sure their <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> setting is enabled.
	<li>If updating from an earlier version of BOSS and you moved any userlists you have to a temporary location, after you have run BOSS at least once for each game with a userlist, you will need to move your userlist(s) into the game(s) subfolders that are created within the BOSS folder.
</ol>
<p>See the <a href="#gui">The Graphical User Interface</a> or <a href="#cli">The Command Line Interface</a> sections for information on running BOSS.


<h2 id="remove">Uninstallation</h2>
<p>If BOSS was installed using the installer, then use the uninstaller it provides a link to in the Start Menu to uninstall BOSS. If BOSS was installed manually, simply delete the <q>BOSS</q> folder you installed.


<h2 id="gui">The Graphical User Interface</h2>
<p>The <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> provides a simple way to run BOSS while allowing access to its various settings and more powerful features without having to manually edit any files. It can be launched by clicking the <q>BOSS GUI</q> Start Menu link (if you installed BOSS using the installer) or by running the <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> found in the BOSS folder.
<h3>Startup</h3>
<p>When you first run the GUI, you may be presented with the following dialog.
<figure>
<img alt="select game" src="images/GUI-Select-Game.png"/>
<figcaption>The Select Game dialog.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This dialog is displayed if you did not install the BOSS folder next to a supported game's executable and you have either not run the GUI before, or it cannot find the game that you last ran it for. Pick the game that you want to run BOSS for, and click <q>OK</q>. If you select a game marked <q>(not detected)</q> then you will only be able to download the latest masterlist for that game, and not sort any plugins.
<p>After you have selected a game and clicked <q>OK</q>, the dialog will close and you will be presented with the GUI's main window.
<h3>The Main Window</h3>
<figure>
<img alt="main window" src="images/GUI-Main.png"/>
<figcaption>The BOSS GUI's main window, containing the most commonly used options.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The title bar of the main window displays which game the GUI is running for: this may also be checked by seeing which game is selected in the <q>Active Game</q> menu.
<p>The buttons and options are all fairly self-explanatory, but are detailed in the tables below. The <q>Run BOSS</q> button and <q>File&#x2192;Run BOSS</q> menu entry both do exactly the same thing, as do the <q>View BOSS Log</q> button and <q>File&#x2192;View BOSS Log</q> menu entry, and the <q>Edit User Rules</q> button and <q>Edit&#x2192;User Rules...</q> menu entry.
<p>The behaviour of the <q>Active Game</q> menu requires some explanation. The menu allows you to change which game the GUI is running for without having to close and re-open it. Games that the GUI cannot find are greyed out, and the active game, ie. the one the GUI is running for, is marked with a dot to its left. To change the active game, simply select another game in the list. Setting the run type to <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> will un-grey all the games, allowing any of them to be selected, while changing from <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> to another run type will grey out undetected games again. If an undetected game is active when you change run type, the GUI will automatically switch to the first detected game in the list.
<p>The run options on the right of the main window decide how BOSS runs. BOSS has three main modes of operation that are mutually exclusive to one another: it can either sort your plugins, only update your masterlist then quit or undo its changes to your load order. The options specific to each mode of operation are listed under each mode's radio button. When BOSS sorts your plugins, it will re-order the plugins it recognises to their correct positions, putting any plugins it doesn't recognise after them in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.

<h3>The User Rules Manager</h3>
<figure>
<img alt="user rules editor window" src="images/GUI-User-Rules-Manager.png"/>
<figcaption>The User Rules Manager, a graphical interface for customising how BOSS sorts your plugins and what messages it displays.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>BOSS's sorting of your plugins and the messages it displays can be customised using <em>user rules</em>. User rules can:
<ol>
	<li>Sort plugins relative to other plugins. Plugins can be <code>.esp</code> or <code>.esm</code> files, and you can both override the positions of plugins BOSS recognises and sort plugins that are unrecognised.
	<li>Sort groups of plugins relative to other groups of plugins. BOSS's masterlist generally lists plugins in thematic groups, which you can override the relative positioning of. You can't create new groups though.
	<li>Insert plugins into the top or bottom of groups of plugins.
	<li>Edit the messages BOSS attaches to plugins. You can add new messages to them, or replace them with your own messages.
</ol>
<p>The User Rules Manager allows easy management of your user rules without having to know any of their syntax (though if you want to customise messages, you need to know their syntax - fortunately it is pretty simple).
<p>The <q>User Rules</q> box lists any user rules you have created. Rules are applied in the order they are listed, and their order can be changed using the <q>Move Rule Up</q> and <q>Move Rule Down</q> buttons at the bottom of the window. A rule that is greyed out and has its checkbox unchecked is disabled, and will not be applied when BOSS is run. The currently selected rule is highlighted with a grey background.

<p>If a rule was created to sort a plugin that was not listed in the masterlist, and that plugin was then added to the masterlist in an update, the User Rules Manager will automatically disable the rule when it loads, to signify that the rule is no longer required. You can then choose to re-enable the rule by checking its checkbox, or delete it, by selecting the rule and clicking the <q>Delete Rule</q> button at the bottom of the window.
<p>Clicking on a rule will load it into the <q>Rule Editor</q> box, where you can then change what it does and either overwrite the existing rule with your edits, using the <q>Save Edited Rule</q> button, or create a new rule from your edits, using the <q>Create New Rule</q> button.
<p>The <q>Installed Plugins</q> tab lists all the plugins found in the active game's Data folder. Plugins are listed in load order. The <q>Masterlist</q> tab displays the masterlist contents as a tree list, showing the plugins in their groups. Double clicking on a collapsed group will expand it, showing the plugins and groups it contains, while double clicking on an expanded group will collapse it, hiding the plugins and groups it contains. Selecting a plugin will display the messages attached to it by the masterlist in the <q>Default Plugin Messages</q> box. You can search either list using the search box at the top of each tab. Searching looks for matches from the start of plugin and group names, and is performed when the <code>Enter</code> keyboard key is pressed, and may be cancelled by clicking the grey cross that appears in the search box.

<p>How to use the Rule Editor:
<ol>
	<li>Drag and drop the plugin or group you want to sort and/or edit messages for from the <q>Installed Plugins</q> or <q>Masterlist</q> tab into the <q>For</q> text box. You can also type the plugin/group name in yourself.
	<li>If you want to sort the plugin or group, check the <q>Sort Item</q> checkbox.
	<ul>
		<li>If you want to sort the plugin/group after another plugin/group, make sure the <q>Sort</q> radio button is selected and choose <q>before</q> or <q>after</q> as desired from the drop down box next to it. Drag and drop (or type in) the plugin/group you want to sort your plugin/group relative to into the text box next to the drop-down box.
		<li>If the item you're sorting is a plugin, not a group, and you want to insert the plugin into a group, make sure the <q>Insert</q> radio button is selected and choose <q>top</q> or <q>bottom</q> as desired from the drop down box next to it. Then drag and drop the group you want to insert the plugin into from the <q>Masterlist</q> tab into the text box next to the drop-down menu.
	</ul>
	<li>If the item you're creating a rule for is a plugin, and you want to edit the messages attached to it, check the <q>Add the following messages</q> checkbox.
	<ul>
		<li>Any messages you write in the text box following the checkbox will be added to the plugin in addition to those already attached by the masterlist. If you want to replace the messages attached by the masterlist with your own, also check the <q>Replace Existing Messages</q> checkbox.
		<li>Any messages you write in the text box must be written using the correct syntax, a summary of which is given in the <a href="#">BOSS Message Format</a> section of the User Rules Readme.
	</ul>
</ol>
<p>When you click either of the <q>Create New Rule</q> or <q>Save Edited Rule</q> buttons, the User Rules Manager will check that the rule has valid syntax, and warn you of any errors encountered. Invalid rules will not be saved.
<p>Once you have finished editing your user rules, use the <q>Save and Exit</q> button to save your changes to your userlist, or the <q>Cancel</q> button to exit without saving.
<p>Further information on user rules, including the details on their syntax, can be found in the <a href="BOSS%20User%20Rules%20ReadMe.html">BOSS User Rules ReadMe</a>.

<h2 id="bosslog">The BOSS Log</h2>
<h3>General</h3>
<figure>
<img alt="boss log" src="images/Log.png"/>
<figcaption>The HTML-format BOSS Log.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The BOSS Log is where you will find all of BOSS's outputted information. It can be generated in either HTML format (the default) or as a plain text file with minimal formatting. The HTML format has significant advantages over the plain text format, being considerably easier to read, containing colour-coded messages and a variety of interactive features to customise what is displayed.

<p>Both log formats contain the following sections:
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>BOSS Log Section<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Summary<td>This section gives a short summary of BOSS's actions. It breaks down the numbers of plugins installed and messages attached to them and gives the local masterlist version and whether or not it was updated. If the BOSS Log is in the HTML format it will also display a message if your recognised plugin list has not changed since you last ran BOSS.
		<tr><td>General Messages<td>This section is only displayed if there are any applicable messages to be displayed. Its primary purpose is to allow BOSS to display messages specific to your Oblivion install that are not specific to any one mod. Parser and updater error messages are also displayed in this section.
		<tr><td>User Rules<td>This section is only displayed if BOSS finds any user rules in your userlist. It details the successes or failures of the application of your userlist rules.
		<tr><td>Script Extender Plugins<td>This section is displayed if you have your game's Script Extender installed. It will list the Script Extender and any plugins for it that you have installed, displaying their versions (if given) and their CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled).
		<tr><td>Recognised Plugins<br /><i>or</i><br />Restored Load Order<td>This section comprises the bulk of BOSS's output, listing all your recognised installed plugins and any messages BOSS has attached to them, as well as version information (if given) and the plugin CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled). If you are running BOSS to undo its changes, this section is titled <q>Restored Load Order</q>, and lists the restored load order.
		<tr><td>Unrecognised Plugins<td>This section is only displayed if you have plugins installed that are unrecognised by BOSS, and lists them. These plugins should be reported in an official BOSS thread with download links to their mods so they can be added to the relevant masterlist.
</table>
<p>BOSS will display the version numbers of any plugins that provide them in their description fields. If a plugin supplies no version number, it cannot be displayed. The version numbers may not reflect the actual version of the mod installed - this could either be due to the mod author forgetting to update the description, or due to a mistake in BOSS's detection. As version numbers are supplied by mod authors in a wide range of formats and BOSS has to detect as many as possible, it occasionally identifies parts of some descriptions as version numbers incorrectly. When in doubt, check the version number given in a mod's readme. 
<p>It should be noted that the vast majority of BOSS's mod messages are non-conditional, in that they are not displayed in response to your specific install. For example, a message that gives some of the mod's incompatibilities does not know if you have them installed or not, and a message telling you to do something will not know if it has been done.
<p>BOSS's mod messages are one of the most important features BOSS provides, acting as a means of providing users with information that they might otherwise not obtain. It is important for a stable, healthy game that you act on any messages that require action. If you think a message suggests an action that is not necessary, report it to an official BOSS thread. While the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities will automatically import and apply Bash Tag suggestions from BOSS, some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention, so read the suggestions made thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> if necessary.
<p>Unrecognised mods must be re-ordered by hand using a mod manager such as <abbr title="Nexus Mod Manager">NMM</abbr>/<abbr title="Oblivion Mod Manager">OBMM</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Mod Manager">FOMM</abbr> or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>, or using BOSS's <a href="#userRules">user rules</a> functionality.

<h3>The HTML BOSS Log</h3>

<p>While the plain text BOSS Log simply lists the sections detailed above and their contents, the HTML BOSS Log functions more like an extension of the BOSS program, and uses a much richer interface. It requires a minimum of Internet Explorer 8, Firefox 3.5, Chrome 4, Safari 4, Opera 10.5 or any equivalent browser to function and display correctly, though some of the features have additional requirements with varying levels of browser support. When the BOSS Log is opened, it will display a <q>Browser Compatibility</q> panel detailing which of these features the browser being used supports, and which it does not, with unsupported features being automatically disabled.
<p>The HTML BOSS Log's additional features are:
<h4>Filters</h4>
<p>The BOSS Log's filters can be used to selectively hide different types of information in the BOSS Log from view, making it easier to see what you're looking for. The filters are found in a floating panel at the bottom of the window that can have its visibility toggled by clicking on the <q>Filters</q> button in the sidebar. Filters are turned on and off via their checkboxes, and the numbers of hidden plugins and messages are given below the filter checkboxes. If a filter doesn't apply to the currently-displayed BOSS Log section, its checkbox is disabled. The filters available are:
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>BOSS Log Filter<td>Description
	<tbody>

<h4>In-Log Unrecognised Plugin Submission</h4>
<p>The submission of unrecognised plugins by users is vital to the upkeep of BOSS. The HTML BOSS Log allows you to submit such plugins without having to register for an account on the official Bethesda Softworks forums and post in one of BOSS's official threads, instead anonymously sending the plugin filename together with a link to the plugin's download location and/or a description of the plugin to the BOSS Development Team's unrecognised plugin tracker, so that it can then be added to the masterlist. 
<p>The Submit Plugin interface is displayed by clicking on a plugin in the <q>Unrecognised Plugins</q> section of the BOSS Log, but only if your browser supports the feature. If unrecognised plugins are not displayed with a dotted underline which becomes a solid underline when you hover over them with your mouse, then your browser does not support this feature.
<h4>CSS Settings</h4>
<p>The CSS Settings panel is displayed by clicking on the <q>CSS Settings</q> button in the sidebar. In it, you can choose to use the BOSS Log's alternative colour scheme, which is more suitable for reading in low light levels and reduces eye strain, by checking the <q>Use Alternative Colour Scheme</q> checkbox at the bottom of the panel.
<p>You can customise the colours that are used by the alternative colour scheme for each of the elements listed. If your browser supports the colour picker input type, then the elements in the <q>Colours</q> columns are displayed as colour pickers that allow you to visually select a colour. If your browser does not support the colour picker input type, the elements in the <q>Colours</q> columns will be displayed as text boxes. If your browser supports placeholders, then the defaults for each element will be displayed as placeholders. Colours must be specified using their lowercase hexadecimal codes. If your browser supports form validation, your custom colours will not be applied unless they have been specified properly.
<p>You can also back up and restore your custom colours in this panel, provided your browser supports the feaure. The colours currently given in the inputs can be backed up by clicking on the underlined <u>back up</u> text button in the paragraph following the inputs. Clicking this button will cause the BOSS Log to generate a file that contains your settings and make it available for your browser to download, at which point your browser's default behaviour for downloading files takes over. Note that your browser will most likely give the settings file a nonsensical name, but you can rename the file to whatever you want, including changing its extension, without breaking anything. You can then restore colour settings from a settings file by dragging and dropping the file into the CSS Settings panel: the panel will change colour when you hover over it to tell you that you can drop the file in it. When the file is dropped into the CSS Settings panel, its settings will be applied.
<p>Note that to apply any changes you make in the CSS Settings panel, you must click the <q>Apply</q> button. If you leave the CSS Settings panel without clicking the <q>Apply</q> button, then your changes will be discarded.
<h4>Settings Memory</h4>
<p>The Settings Memory feature allows the BOSS Log to remember the following settings when you close it, and re-apply them when you next open it:
<ul>
	<li>Which filters you have applied.
	<li>Whether or not you are using the alternative colour scheme.
	<li>What your custom alernative colour scheme colours are.
	<li>Whether or not you want to stop the Browser Compatibility panel from being displayed.
</ul>
<p>The settings stored are unique to each BOSS Log, so if you run BOSS for two different games, each BOSS Log's settings will be stored separately. Also, the settings are stored in your browser's cache, so if you clear your browsing data, the settings will be lost, hence why there is a custom colours backup/restore feature available.


<h2 id="help">Contributions &amp; Help</h2>
<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.
<p>General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised or unclean plugins, takes place in BOSS's official threads for 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1195328">Oblivion</a>, 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1132338">Nehrim</a>, 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1256118">Skyrim</a>,

<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1313081">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.
<p>You can also submit unrecognised plugins directly from your BOSS Log, providing your browser supports the feature, by clicking on any unrecognised plugin listed and filling in the submission form that is displayed. The submission is sent anonymously to BOSS's tracker so that the team then know to add it. This avoids the need for users to register for a new forum account, and is generally a more efficient submission method.
<p>Lists of unrecognised plugins are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>A link to where the description, mod or readme can be found to read or download.
	<li>A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.
</ul>
<p>Lists of dirty plugins are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The CRC(s) of the dirty ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the dirty files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the <q>CRC checksum for data</q> is the one required.
</ul>


<h3 id="cli">Command Line Arguments</h3>
<p>While the BOSS GUI allows you to specify options using its graphical elements, the CLI uses a combination of the BOSS.ini file and command line arguments to do the same. The syntax for these arguments is:
<code class="box">boss [-hVuosdctUl] [-g [game]] [-r [level]] [-v [level]] [-f [type]] [-H [hostname]] [-P [port]]</code>
<code class="box">-h [ --help ]</code>
<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments, then exits.
<code class="box">-V [ --version ]</code>
<p>Prints the a banner displaying the program name and version number to the command line, then exits.
<code class="box">-u [ --update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sorts your plugins. This behaviour is enabled by default, so the command line parameter will have no effect except when the automatic masterlist updating has been disabled in the ini.
<code class="box">-U [ --no-update ]</code>
<p>Inhibits the default automatic masterlist updater, preventing it from running. Must not be used alongside --update,-u.
<code class="box">-o [ --only-update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then does <b>not</b> sort your plugins.
<code class="box">-g [ --game ] [ game ]</code>
<p>Overrides game autodetection. The valid values of the argument are: <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code>, <code>FalloutNV</code>, <code>Skyrim</code> and <code>Morrowind</code>. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS falls back to autodetection, unless <code>-o</code> is also passed, in which case BOSS will run successfully whether or not the game is installed.
<code class="box">-s [ --silent ]</code>
<p>Stops BOSS from automatically opening up the BOSS Log in your web browser (or text editor, depending on format chosen) after it has finished running.
<code class="box">-c [ --crc-display ]</code>
<p>Calculates the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, including <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Skyrim Script Extender">SKSE</abbr> plugins, and displays them in your BOSS Log alongside the plugin names.
<code class="box">-f [ --format ] [ type ]</code>
<p>Allows the selection of the BOSS Log format. Valid argument values are: <code>html</code> and <code>text</code>. <code>html</code> is the default output format. The <code>text</code> value will print the BOSS Log as plain text into a 'BOSSlog.txt' file, similar to the BOSS Log in BOSS v1.5 and below.
<code class="box">-t [ --trial-run ]</code>
<p>BOSS runs, but no plugins are redated, so your load order is not changed. The BOSS Log still displays the order BOSS would have placed them in, so it is useful for checking what would happen if you ran BOSS on your load order without having to then undo BOSS's changes.
<code class="box">-r [ --revert ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Revert to a previous load order. This parameter optionally accepts values of <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>, indicating how many undo steps to apply. If no option is specified, it defaults to <code>1</code>. A value of <code>1</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
A value of <code>2</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.
<code class="box">-v [ --verbose ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Specify the verbosity level (<code>0</code> to <code>3</code>) of the debugging output. <code>0</code> is the default, showing only warning and error messages. <code>1</code> (warning, error and informational messages) is implied if this option is specified without an argument. Higher values increase the verbosity further.
<code class="box">-d [ --debug-with-source ]</code>
<p>Adds source file references (filenames and line numbers) to debugging statements.
<code class="box">-l [ log-debug ]</code>
<p>Logs the debug output to the <q>BOSSDebugLog.txt</q> file instead of the command line.
<code class="box">-H [ --proxy-host ] [ hostname ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy hostname for the masterlist updater. The hostname may be an actual hostname (eg. <code>proxy.company.com</code>), an IP address (eg. <code>192.168.32.4</code>) or <code>none</code>. <code>none</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.
<code class="box">-P [ --proxy-port ] [ port ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy port number for the masterlist updater. The port number may be any valid port number. <code>0</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.

<h3 id="ini">The BOSS.ini</h3>
<p>Users can edit all of BOSS's settings in the BOSS.ini. As this is where BOSS gets its settings from when both running the CLI client and when loading the GUI client, care must be taken to edit it correctly to prevent breaking BOSS's operation. If BOSS is run and it cannot find a BOSS.ini, it will generate a new one with default settings. If BOSS is run with both a BOSS.ini present and command line parameters set, the command line parameters override the settings in BOSS.ini. The ini is split into the following sections:
<h4>BOSS.GeneralSettings</h4>
<p>These settings control miscellaneous areas of BOSS's operation outside of the main sorting functionality.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>bDoStartupUpdateCheck<td><code>true</code><td><code>true</code>, <code>false</code><td>Controls whether or not BOSS's Automatic Updater checks for new releases when BOSS is run.
		<tr><td>bUseUserRulesEditor<td><code>true</code><td><code>true</code>, <code>false</code><td>Controls whether the GUI uses the User Rules Editor window to edit user rules or whether it opens the userlist.txt for manual editing.
		<tr><td>sLanguage<td><code>english</code><td><code>english</code>, <code>german</code>, <code>russian</code>, <code>spanish</code><td>Controls the language BOSS uses in its interfaces. Note that plugin messages are always displayed in English.
</table>
<h4>BOSS.InternetSettings</h4>
<p>These settings control how the masterlist updater and GUI auto-updater connect to the Internet. They are shared by BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe, and can be overriden for the masterlist updater using BOSS's command line parameters. They may also be edited through the GUI. You will probably know if you need to alter them.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>sProxyHostname<td>Default is an empty string.<td>An empty string, hostname (eg. <code>proxy.company.com</code>), IP address (eg. <code>192.168.32.4</code>)<td>The hostname for the proxy host used, if a proxy is required to connect to the Internet. If no hostname is given, BOSS assumes that no proxy should be used.
		<tr><td>iProxyPort<td><code>0</code><td>Any valid port number.<td>The port used to connect to the proxy host, if a proxy is required to connect to the Internet. <code>0</code> tells BOSS to use no proxy.
		<tr><td>sProxyUsername<td>Default is an empty string.<td>Any string of characters.<td>The username BOSS uses to connect to the Internet through an authenticated proxy. If no username is given, then BOSS assumes that any proxy used is unauthenticated.
		<tr><td>sProxyPassword<td>Default is an empty string.<td>Any string of characters.<td>The password BOSS ues to connect to the Internet through an authenticated proxy. If no password is given, then BOSS assumes that any proxy used is unauthenticated.
</table>
<h4>BOSS.RunOptions</h4>
<p>These settings specify BOSS's run options. They allow you to run BOSS with non-default settings without having to use the command line or the GUI.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>sGame<td><code>auto</code><td><code>auto</code>, <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code>, <code>FalloutNV</code>, <code>Skyrim</code>, <code>Morrowind</code><td>If set to something other than <code>auto</code>, this overrides game autodetection. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS falls back to autodetection, unless <code>bOnlyUpdateMasterlist = true</code>, in which case BOSS will run successfully whether or not the game is installed.
		<tr><td>sLastGame<td><code>auto</code><td><code>auto</code>, <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code>, <code>FalloutNV</code>, <code>Skyrim</code>, <code>Morrowind</code><td>This setting records the last game that the GUI was run for. If <code>sGame = auto</code> then this setting's value is used to override game selection, providing the specified game can be detected. If the game cannot be detected, or it is set to <code>auto</code>, then game selection occurs as normal.
		<tr><td>sBOSSLogFormat<td><code>html</code><td><code>html</code>, <code>text</code><td>Specify the format of the BOSS Log generated.
		<tr><td>iDebugVerbosity<td><code>0</code><td><code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code>, <code>3</code><td>The verbosity of the debug logging output. As values increase, so does verbosity. <code>0</code> displays only warning and error messages.
		<tr><td>iRevertLevel<td><code>0</code><td><code>0</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>2</code><td>Specify how many runs of BOSS to undo. <code>0</code> tells BOSS to run as normal.

<h2 id="intro">Introduction</h2>
<p>While BOSS is able to sort the large number of plugins listed in its masterlist without any user input, you may find that you wish to customise 
the sorting of your plugins. This may be to include plugins not listed in the masterlist (either plugins not yet added or temporary plugins or private files not suitable for masterlist inclusion), or it could be to rearrange plugins present in the masterlist that can be loaded in a different configuration 
for different results (eg. LAME and Supreme Magicka files). You may also wish to add extra messages to plugins, or edit existing messages.
<p>One possible solution is to edit your copy of the masterlist to include the desired changes. However, as updating your masterlist will remove 
these edits, this is not very suitable as a long term solution.
<p>This is where user rules come in. Using a separate userlist file, you can define rules for sorting specific plugins or groups of plugins as you like, 
as well as for adding or editing messages attached to plugins, and these rules will not be lost when you update your masterlist.

<h2 id="start">Getting Started With The Userlist</h2>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This ReadMe refers to .esp and .esm files as 'plugins'. Unless explicitely stated, the 'name' of a 'plugin' refers to its filename, including the extension. Also, while the examples in this ReadMe reference Oblivion and some of its plugins, the functionality will work for all the games BOSS supports. When your game's master .ESM file is mentioned, this refers to Oblivion.esm, Nehrim.esm, Fallout3.esm or FalloutNV.esm for Oblivion, Nehrim, Fallout 3 or Fallout: New Vegas respectively.
<p>The userlist is the file which contains your custom rules for sorting plugins and editing plugins' messages. It is found at <code>BOSS\[GAME]\userlist.txt</code>, where <code>[GAME]</code> is one of <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Skyrim</code>, <code>Fallout 3</code> or <code>Fallout New Vegas</code>, depending on the game the userlist is for. A blank userlist is automatically created for a game when BOSS is first run for that game.
<p>Within this file, which you can edit in Notepad or any other text editor, you list your rule definitions. Rules can make two types of changes:
<ol>
	<li><em>Sort plugins and groups.</em> You can:
		<ul>
			<li>Sort plugins relative to other plugins. You can both override the positions of plugins BOSS recognises and sort plugins unrecognised by BOSS.
			<li>Sort groups of plugins relative to other groups of plugins. You can override the positions of the groups in the BOSS sorts plugins into.
			<li>Insert plugins into groups. You can put plugins at the beginning or end of groups.
		</ul>
		Plugins may be .esp or .esm files. Groups are all pre-defined in the BOSS masterlist, marked out by the 
	<code>\BeginGroup\: <var>Group Name</var></code> and <code>\EndGroup\\</code>, or <code>BEGINGROUP: <var>Group Name</var></code> and <code>ENDGROUP</code>, lines.
	<li><em>Edit BOSS messages.</em> You can add to or replace the plugin-specific messages that are displayed in the BOSS Log.
	See <a href="#messages">The BOSS Message Format</a> below for more details on the message types and syntax.
</ol>
<p>The rule definition syntax is simple and concise, and is explained below.

<h2 id="basics">Rule Basics</h2>
<p>While it is strongly suggested that you read the <a href="#syntax">Rule Definition Syntax</a> section below to gain a proper understanding of user rules, here is a quick start guide for some simple rules.
<h3 id="basics-add">Sorting An Unknown Plugin</h3>
<p>To sort a plugin that is not in the masterlist after another plugin:

<code class="box">ADD: <var>[RULE PLUGIN]</var>
AFTER: <var>[SORT PLUGIN]</var></code>

<p>To sort it before another plugin:

<code class="box">ADD: <var>[RULE PLUGIN]</var>
BEFORE: <var>[SORT PLUGIN]</var></code>

<p>The <em>rule plugin</em> is the plugin you want to add, and the <em>sort plugin</em> is the plugin you want to sort it relative to.
<p>Examples:
<code class="box">ADD: Plugin1.esp
AFTER: AFK_Weye.esp

ADD: Plugin2.esp
BEFORE: AFK_Weye.esp</code>
<p>This gives a load order of:
<blockquote>
...<br />
Plugin2.esp<br />
AFK_Weye.esp<br />
Plugin1.esp<br />
...
</blockquote>

<h3 id="basics-override">Changing A Recognised Plugin's Position</h3>
<p>To sort a plugin that is already in the masterlist after another plugin:
<code class="box">OVERRIDE: <var>[RULE PLUGIN]</var>
AFTER: <var>[SORT PLUGIN]</var></code>
<p>To sort it before another plugin:
<code class="box">OVERRIDE: <var>[RULE PLUGIN]</var>
BEFORE: <var>[SORT PLUGIN]</var></code>
<p>The <em>rule plugin</em> is the plugin you want to sort, and the <em>sort plugin</em> is the plugin you want to sort it relative to.
<p>Example:
<code class="box">OVERRIDE: bgBalancingEVCore.esp
AFTER: Unofficial Oblivion Patch.esp</code>
<p>This gives a load order of:
<blockquote>
...<br />
Unofficial Oblivion Patch.esp<br />
bgBalancingEVCore.esp<br />
...
</blockquote>

<h3 id="basics-message">Editing A Plugin's BOSS Log Messages &amp; Bash Tag Suggestions</h3>
<p>To add a message to a plugin for display in the BOSS Log:
<code class="box">FOR: <var>[RULE PLUGIN]</var>
APPEND: <var>[MESSAGE OBJECT]</var></code>
<p>To replace the messages attached to a plugin for display in the BOSS Log:
<code class="box">FOR: <var>[RULE PLUGIN]</var>
REPLACE: <var>[MESSAGE OBJECT]</var></code>
<p>The <em>rule plugin</em> is the plugin you want to add the message to. The <em>message object</em> is the formatted BOSS message that you want to attach. See the <a href="#messages">The BOSS Message Format</a> section later on in this readme if you are unfamiliar with BOSS message formatting.
<p>An example:
<code class="box">FOR: Unofficial Oblivion Patch.esp
REPLACE: ? Replaced!

FOR: bgMagicEV.esp.esp
APPEND: % {{BASH:Names,Delev,Relev}}</code>
<p>This will print in the BOSS Log:
<blockquote>
...<br /><br />
Unofficial Oblivion Patch.esp
<ul>
	<li>Note:  Replaced!
</ul>
...<br /><br />
bgMagicEV.esp.esp
<ul>
	<li>Bashed Patch tag suggestion: {{BASH:Names,Delev,Relev}}
</ul>
...
</blockquote>

<h2 id="syntax">Rule Definition Syntax</h2>
<p>User rules have a specific structure and syntax which your rules must follow to be applied. The information below provides the details on this structure and syntax.
<h3 id="syntax-rule">The Rule Line</h3>
<p>Every rule begins with a <em>rule line</em>, which defines what basic type of rule it is and what plugin it is applied to. It has the structure:
<code class="box"><var>[RULE KEYWORD]</var>: <var>[RULE OBJECT]</var></code>
<p>This is the <em>rule line</em>. The <em>rule keyword</em> can be one of:
<ul>
	<li><dfn>ADD</dfn>: This tells BOSS that the rule sorts a plugin that is not in the 
	masterlist. The rule may also add and/or edit messages attached to that plugin.
	<li><dfn>OVERRIDE</dfn>: This tells BOSS that the rule overrides the current position of a plugin or group in the masterlist with a new position. 
	The rule may also add and/or edit messages attached to that plugin.
	<li><dfn>FOR</dfn>: This tells BOSS that the rule adds and/or edits the messages attached to a plugin, but does not sort it.
</ul>
<p>The <em>rule object</em> is the plugin or group that the rule is applied to. If the rule keyword is ADD or FOR, the rule object must be a plugin.
<p>When you define groups, the names of those groups are used as they appear in the masterlist. For example, 
if you wanted to reference the group of plugins that begins with <code>\BeginGroup\: Supreme Magicka</code>, you would put it in the rule as <code>Supreme Magicka</code>.
<p>There is one more keyword that can be used on the rule line. <code>DISABLE</code> can be put before the rule keyword to prevent the rule from being applied. For example:
<code class="box">DISABLE ADD: MyMod.esp
AFTER: Unofficial Oblivion Patch.esp
</code>
<p>Would result in MyMod.esp not being sorted after Unofficial Oblivon Patch.esp. The <code>DISABLE</code> keyword should be used instead of silent comments to stop a rule being applied because the latter makes the rule invisible to the GUI's User Rule Editor whereas the former does not.

<h3 id="syntax-sort">The Sort Line</h3>
<p>If a rule's rule keyword is ADD or OVERRIDE, it can sort plugins and should include a <em>sort line</em> directly below the rule line. If the rule keyword is FOR, the rule <b>must not</b> include a sort line. A rule may only contain one sort line. The sort line has the structure:
<code class="box"><var>[SORT KEYWORD]</var>: <var>[SORT OBJECT]</var></code>
<p>The <em>sort keyword</em> can be one of:
<ul>
	<li><dfn>BEFORE</dfn>: This states that the rule object is to load immediately before the sort object.
	<li><dfn>AFTER</dfn>: This states that the rule object is to load immediately after the sort object.
	<li><dfn>TOP</dfn>: This states that the rule plugin is to be inserted into the top of the sort group. The rule plugin will then load before everything else in the sort group.
	<li><dfn>BOTTOM</dfn>: This states that the rule plugin is to be inserted into the bottom of the sort group. The rule plugin will then load after everything else in the sort group.
</ul>
<p>When using the BEFORE or AFTER sort keywords, the <em>sort object</em> is the plugin or group that you wish the rule object 
to be positioned relative to. Plugins must be sorted relative to other plugins, and groups must be sorted relative to groups. You cannot sort plugins relative to groups, or vice versa. You also cannot sort your game's master .ESM, sort other plugins before it, or sort groups before the "ESMs" group.
<p>When using the TOP or BOTTOM sort keywords, the <em>sort object</em> is the <b>group</b> that you wish to insert the rule plugin into. You cannot insert groups into anything, plugins into plugins, or insert anything into the top of the <q>ESMs</q> group.

<h3 id="syntax-message">The Message Line</h3>
<p>If a rule's rule keyword is FOR, it should include at least one <em>message line</em>. A rule with a rule keyword of ADD or OVERRIDE can also include message lines, if they sort a plugin. Message lines have the structure:
<code class="box"><var>[MESSAGE KEYWORD]</var>: <var>[MESSAGE OBJECT]</var></code>
<p>The <em>message keyword</em> can be one of:
<ul>
	<li><dfn>APPEND</dfn>: This states that the message is to be appended to the list of messages attached to the rule plugin.
	<li><dfn>REPLACE</dfn>: This states that the message is to replace any existing message or messages attached to the rule plugin. You may only have up to one <code>REPLACE</code> message line per rule, and if used it must be the first message line.
</ul>
<p>The <em>message object</em> is the message, complete with symbol code, that you wish to attach to the plugin defined by the rule object. You cannot attach messages to groups.
<p>You may have multiple message lines in a rule (but only the first may use the <code>REPLACE</code> message keyword), to add multiple messages to a plugin, or to override an existing set of messages with a new set.

<h3 id="syntax-examples">Examples</h3>
<p>Here is the contents of an example userlist:
<code class="box">ADD: MyPluginToAdd.esp
AFTER: LoadAfterThis.esm
APPEND: ? Adding a general message.
APPEND: $ Incompatible with OOO!

OVERRIDE: MyPluginToOverride.esp
BEFORE: LoadBeforeThis.esp

OVERRIDE: L.A.M.E.
BEFORE: Supreme Magicka

FOR: bgBalancingEVOptionalNPCDiversity, Vanilla.esp
REPLACE: ? This is a replacement message.
APPEND: % {{BASH:NpcFaces,NoMerge}}</code>
<p>This is the equivalent of the masterlist having:
<blockquote>
...<br />
LoadAfterThis.esm<br />
MyPluginToAdd.esp<br />
? Adding a general message.<br />
$ Incompatible with OOO!<br />
...<br />
MyPluginToOverride.esp<br />
LoadBeforeThis.esp<br />
...<br />
bgBalancingEVOptionalNPCDiversity, Vanilla.esp<br />
? This is a replacement message.<br />
% {{BASH:NpcFaces,NoMerge}}<br />
...
</blockquote>
<p>Which would give in the BOSS Log:
<blockquote>
...<br />
LoadAfterThis.esm<br />
MyPluginToAdd.esp
<ul>
	<li>Note: Adding a general message.
	<li>Note: Incompatible with OOO!
</ul>
...<br />
MyPluginToOverride.esp<br />
LoadBeforeThis.esp<br />
...<br />
bgBalancingEVOptionalNPCDiversity, Vanilla.esp
<ul>
<li> Note: This is a replacement message.
<li> Bash Tag Suggestion(s): {{BASH:NpcFaces,NoMerge}}
</ul>
...
</blockquote>
<p>The rule sorting the two groups L.A.M.E. and Supreme Magicka simply moves the L.A.M.E. group from its current position to before the Supreme Magicka group.

<h2 id="apply">Enforcing Your Rules</h2>
<p>When BOSS is run, it will look for your userlist at <code>BOSS\[GAME]\userlist.txt</code>, where <code>[GAME]</code> is one of <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Skyrim</code>, <code>Fallout 3</code> or <code>Fallout New Vegas</code>, depending on the game BOSS is running for. If it is found, and the userlist contains at least one rule, BOSS will first check the syntax of the rules, and apply those with the correct syntax. 
It will print error messages detailing the problems with any rules it skips, and success messages for the plugins that are applied, into your BOSS Log, in the <q>Userlist Messages</q> section near the top. Disabled rules have their syntax checked, but are not applied.
<p>If a rule is successfully applied, it will print one or more messages depending on what the rule does:
<ol>
	<li>If the rule includes a sort line and uses the sort keywords BEFORE or AFTER, it will print a message of the form: <code>"<var>Plugin/Group Name</var>" sorted <var>before/after</var> "<var>Plugin/Group Name</var>".</code>
	<li>If the rule includes a sort line and uses the sort keywords TOP or BOTTOM, it will print a message of the form: <code>"<var>Plugin Name</var>" inserted into the <var>top/bottom</var> of group "<var>Group Name</var>".</code>
	<li>If the rule includes one or more message lines, each message line will give a message of the form: <code>"<var>Message</var>" <var>appended to/replaced</var> messages attached to "<var>Plugin Name</var>".</code>
</ol>
<p>If the parser finds a major grammatical error in your userlist, it will stop parsing and discard any rules it has found before printing an error message detailing what was expected and where. In some cases, the expected item may not provide much useful meaning - in these cases look at where the error was found and determine the exact cause of the problem yourself.
<p>If a rule is found to have errors in its syntax, it will be skipped and an error message of the form: <code>Syntax Error: The rule beginning "<var>First Line Of Rule</var>" <var>details of error</var></code> will be printed to your BOSS Log. See the main BOSS ReadMe for a full list of possible syntax errors.
<p>If an error is encountered while trying to apply a rule, it will be skipped and an error message detailing the fault will be printed to your BOSS Log.
<p><b>Rule application does not alter your masterlist.txt or userlist.txt.</b> This means that if you want to undo the application of a rule, all you need to do is remove it from your userlist.txt (or disable it) and re-run BOSS.

<h2 id="notes">Further Notes On Rules</h2>
<p>While the <a href="#syntax">Rule Definition Syntax</a> section gave you most of the rules of defining rules, here are some further general notes on defining rules that may not be evident:
<ol>
	<li>Blank lines or lines beginning with <code>//</code> in your userlist will be ignored by BOSS. You can use blank lines to improve the formatting of your userlist, and use the <code>//</code> line start to provide comments or disable specific rules as you desire.
		<ul>
			<li>You can also begin lines with <code>\</code> instead of <code>//</code> to have the same effect, and comment out multiple lines by enclosing them between <code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code>.
			<li>It is better to use the <code>DISABLE</code> keyword to disable rules, as this means that they are still visible to the GUI's User Rule Editor without being applied. Rules with incorrect syntax should be commented out, as disabled rules are still parsed with error checking.
		</ul>
	<li>User rules are case-insensitive. The only exception is the message object, which will retain its case when displayed in the BOSS Log.
	<li>If a rule's rule plugin is not installed in your Data folder, the rule will be skipped.
	<li>Plugins ghosted by Wrye Bash are treated no differently from non-ghosted plugins, but they must be referenced without their ".ghost" extension.
	<li>The group "ESMs" must always load first. You cannot sort this group or sort another group before it.
	<li>The game's master .ESM file must always load first. You cannot sort it, sort another plugin before it, or insert another plugin into the top of the "ESMs" group.
	<li>You cannot sort a plugin relative to another plugin that is not in the masterlist and has not been sorted by a previous rule.
	<li>You cannot include conditionals in any messages added through user rules. While BOSS will not display any errors, the message will be added as if it were a general message with no conditional.
	<li>You cannot sort mods or groups relative to themselves.
	<li>You cannot sort a non-master plugin before a master, or a master after a non-master plugin. Masters are commonly .ESM files, and non-master plugins are commonly .ESP files, but whether a plugin is a master or not is actually decided by a variable in the file, not the file extension. (An example of this in action would be <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>'s <q>ESMify Self</q> function, which makes a plugin into a master without changing the file extension.)
	<li>
		<p><b>Rules are applied in the order they are listed</b>. This means you can have several rules sorting different rule objects relative to the same sort object, or have rules sorting rule objects relative to sort objects that were sorted in previous rules.
		For example:
		<code class="box">ADD: LoadBeforeThis.esp
AFTER: RTT.esp

ADD: Plugin1.esp
BEFORE: LoadBeforeThis.esp

OVERRIDE: xulAspenWood.esp
AFTER: Plugin1.esp

ADD: Plugin2.esp
BEFORE: RTT.esp</code>
		<p>which will order the plugins as:
		<blockquote>Plugin2.esp<br />
		RTT.esp<br />
		Plugin1.esp<br />
		xulAspenWood.esp<br />
		LoadBeforeThis.esp</blockquote>
		<p>Take care when writing such rules though, as a small difference in the order of the rules in your userlist can have a very large difference on the resulting load order.
</ol>

<h2 id="messages">The BOSS Message Format</h2>
<p>Understanding the BOSS message format is important if you wish to edit plugins' messages. There are actually two formats, either of which may be used. Each of the four message types that can be added via the userlist begins with a <em>message symbol</em> or <em>message keyword</em> depending on the format used. The symbol/keyword is then followed by the message itself. The message is just a standard line of text. In addition, Bash Tag suggestion messages also have a special syntax for the suggestions they include.
<p>The message message types, symbols and keywords are listen in the table below:
<table>
	<thead><tr><td><b>Message Type</b><td><b>Format 1 Symbol</b><td><b>Format 2 Keyword</b>
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Bash Tag Suggestion<td>%<td>TAG:
		<tr><td>General Message<td>?<td>SAY:
		<tr><td>Installation Requirement<td>:<td>REQ:
		<tr><td>Specific Incompatibility<td>"<td>INC:
</table>
<p>The syntax for a Bash Tag suggestion is:
<code class="box">% {{BASH:list suggested tags separated by ", " here}} you may also have some text here.</code>
or:<br />
<code class="box">TAG: {{BASH:list suggested tags separated by ", " here}} you may also have some text here.</code>
<p>For example:
<code class="box">% {{BASH:Names, Graphics}} to prevent changes being lost when using overhauls.</code>
<p>You can also mix the two formats, giving one message in one format and another message in the other. You are not restricted to using only one format.

<h3 id="updates">Keeping BOSS Up-To-Date</h3>
<p>It is important that you keep your BOSS installation updated, not only to benefit from the many frequent updates made to the masterlists, but also to benefit from bug fixes, improvements and new features introduced to new releases of BOSS itself.
<p>Providing there is an Internet connection available when BOSS runs, it will automatically download and apply any updates available for the masterlist of the game it is running for by default. BOSS will also check for new releases and if an update is available it will notify the user, displaying release notes if any are available. Additionally, if you installed BOSS using the automated installer, BOSS will ask the user if they wish to update, and automatically download and run the updated version's installer if so. The check for new releases functionality behaves as outlined below:
<ol>
 <li>On launching, it automatically checks for updates to BOSS. If an update is found, it proceeds to the next step. If no update is available, or no Internet connection is present, it will display no message.
 <ul>
  <li>If you run the <q>Check For Updates</q> option from the GUI's Help option, then it will display messages detailing if no update was found or if there were any errors.
 </ul>
 <li>No matter how the update check was started, if an update is available it will notify the user, asking whether or not to download and install the update if BOSS was installed using the automated installer. If the user decides not to update, the updater will quit.
 <li>If the user decides to update, then it will begin downloading the new installer to the BOSS folder, displaying the progress. If using the GUI, the download can be cancelled at any time, in which case any downloaded file will be deleted and the updater will quit. CLI users can cancel the download by quitting BOSS, but no cleanup will take place.
</ol>
<p>Under certain circumstances the masterlist and program updaters may be unable to function correctly. If you have issues using them, see the <a href="#special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</a> section for alternative methods.

<p>BOSS program updates are also published at the
<a href="http://tes.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516">TES Nexus</a>, 
<a href="http://skyrim.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=6">Skyrim Nexus</a>,
<a href="http://fallout3.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193">Fallout 3 Nexus</a> and 
<a href="http://newvegas.nexusmods.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999">New Vegas Nexus</a> BOSS pages. For those not using the masterlist updater, the latest masterlist is always on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/">Google Code repository</a>.
<p>Always make sure to use the latest version of BOSS and the latest masterlist.


<h3 id="special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</h3>
<p>The vast majority of users will be able to use BOSS's masterlist updater and the auto-updater with no problems. However, some users' circumstances may be such that the standard method will not work. This section provides instructions for those users.
<p>The most common special circumstance is when the computer the user has BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet. In this circumstance, the following instructions should be used to obtain masterlist updates:
<ol>
	<li>Copy <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> from your BOSS folder to the computer with an Internet connection.
	<li>Run <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> and choose the appropriate game when prompted.
	<li>Make sure that the GUI is set to the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> run option.
	<li>If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, also record your proxy settings in the relevant part of the GUI's <q>Settings</q> window.
	<li>Select <q>Run BOSS</q>. The masterlist will be downloaded into a subfolder, named after the game you selected, in the same location as your <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>. Some other BOSS files will also be created, you can safely delete these.
</ol>
<p>A rarer circumstance is when the user connects to the Internet using a proxy. This is most common in enterprise environments, and such users will generally know if they use a proxy. If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you must either record your proxy settings in the relevant part of the GUI's <q>Settings</q> window or manually enter your proxy settings into your <q>BOSS.ini</q> settings file. See the <a href="#customising">Customising How BOSS Works</a> section above for details on the expected settings.
<p>If your circumstances are such that the computer you have BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet, or if you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, it is recommended that you avoid using the auto-updater, simply because it is easier in these circumstances to download new releases through your web browser.
<p>There may also be other special cases which cause problems for BOSS's updaters that the BOSS team is unaware of. If you are having issues using the updaters, contact the BOSS team for support.


<h3 id="files">BOSS Changes and Files</h3>
<p>The only changes BOSS makes to your game install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, and create a few files in your BOSS folder. Your game's master file (Oblivion.esm, Nehrim.esm, Fallout3.esm, FalloutNV.esm or Skyrim.esm) is never altered, and all dates are derived from it.
<p><b>Note:</b> Skyrim v1.4.26+ uses a different load order mechanism to earlier games and versions of Skyrim. It uses the order of plugins in its <q>plugins.txt</q> file (found in the user's local application data folder) to determine load order instead of plugin timestamps. As such, when running for Skyrim v1.4.26+, BOSS will not alter any plugin timestamps but will instead alter the order of the contents of your <q>plugins.txt</q> file.
<p>BOSS stores all its files in the BOSS folder. BOSS's files are detailed in the table below (images for this readme are omitted).
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>File<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>BOSS.exe<td>The <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> for BOSS.
		<tr><td>BOSS GUI.exe<td>The <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> for BOSS.
		<tr><td>BOSSlog.html<td>The log generated by BOSS that is displayed when BOSS runs. It is replaced every time you run BOSS. You can view it in any web browser.
		<tr><td>BOSSlog.txt<td>The plain text version of the log, without HTML formatting. It is only created if you specify the plain text format when running BOSS. You can view it in any text editor.
		<tr><td>BOSSDebugLog.txt<td>The log file for BOSS's debugging output. You can view it in any text editor.
		<tr><td>masterlist.txt<td>The list of plugins that BOSS recognises, listing them in order and including the notes that are displayed in the BOSS Log. It is the most frequently updated component of BOSS, receiving updates almost every day.
		<tr><td>modlist.txt<td>Contains the list of your plugins in the order they were before you last ran BOSS, which can be used to undo changes to your load order.
		<tr><td>modlist.old<td>Contains the contents of your modlist.txt before you last ran BOSS, providing a second level of undo for load order changes.
		<tr><td>userlist.txt<td>Contains your custom rules to be implemented by the User Rules feature.

		<tr><td>Licenses.txt<td>Contains the full text of the GNU General Public License v3.0 and GNU Free Documentation License v1.3 copyright licenses.
		<tr><td>loadorder.txt<td>Holds the load order of all active and inactive plugins installed in a game's Data folder. <b>This file is not stored in the BOSS folder.</b> It is instead found in the user's local application data folder, next to <q>plugins.txt</q>. It forms part of a community adaptation to Bethesda's alteration of the load order system in Skyrim v1.4.26+ to allow the continued load ordering of inactive plugins. As it is intended to be shared between modding utilities, it is not removed when BOSS is uninstalled using the uninstaller or when the BOSS folder is deleted.

<h3 id="dirtymods">Dirty Edits, Mod Cleaning &amp; CRCs</h3>
<p>Dirty edits are often a side-effect of mod creation, and are often due to bugs in the utilities Bethesda has provided to create mods, rather than bad practice by mod authors. Dirty edits can cause a wide range of issues, including incorrect game settings, missing content, broken quests and crashing to desktop. The more dirty edits there are, and the more mods with dirty edits you use, the more likely you are to experience issues.
<p>Thankfully there is a way to remove dirty edits from mods relatively easily, a process known as <i>mod cleaning</i>, using TES4Edit (for Oblivion), FO3Edit (for Fallout 3), FNVEdit (for Fallout: New Vegas) or TES5Edit (for Skyrim). A detailed set of instructions and information on mod cleaning can be found on the CS Wiki's <a href="http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/TES4Edit_Cleaning_Guide">TES4Edit Cleaning Guide</a> (the page also applies to Fallout 3 Fallout: New Vegas and Skyrim). <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> can also scan plugins for dirty edits and return their ITM and UDR counts, though at the time of writing it cannot clean plugins itself.
<p>The problem of dirty edits is largely a problem of ignorance on the part of mod authors and users alike of the problems unclean mods (more widely known as <i>dirty mods</i>) can cause. As such, there are community efforts to raise awareness of dirty edits and cleaning. BOSS plays a key role in these efforts, as it holds the complete list of all known dirty mods, and it uses this information to provide notification messages to users for any dirty mods they have installed.
There are three key pieces of information that are used to accurately describe and identify an unclean mod. They are:
<ul>
	<li><i><abbr title="Identical To Master">ITM</abbr> Count</i>: ITM records are a type of dirty edit where a mod has overwritten something in the game without actually changing anything. If another mod lower in the load order makes an intentional change to that thing, it will have its effect cancelled out by the ITM record, which can cause problems. The ITM count is the number of ITM records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i><abbr title="Undeleted and Disabled Reference">UDR</abbr> Count</i>: Deleting records is a significant cause of crashes and game bugs. UDRs are records that the mod deleted from the game or from another mod that have been corrected safely by undeleting them and disabling them instead, which has the same intended effect without causing issues. The UDR count is the number of deleted reference records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i>CRC</i> or <i>Checksum</i>: A file's CRC is a highly accurate way of identifying it, and is a number calculated from the file's contents. If the contents of a file changes, so will its CRC. BOSS uses CRCs to check if a user's mods are dirty by checking their CRCs against pre-determined CRCs of known dirty mods. This lets BOSS give precise notification messages for any dirty mods it detects. BOSS can calculate the CRCs of all your installed plugins if run from the GUI with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled.
</ul>
<p>However, not all unclean mods have all or any of these pieces of information. For unclean mods whose ITM and UDR counts have not been reported, BOSS cannot give them. For unclean mods whose CRCs have not been reported, BOSS cannot give precise notification and so prints a message whether or not the user has cleaned their mod.
<p>BOSS and the modding communities rely on user contribution of this information to progress. For information on how to contribute, see the <a href="#help">Contributions &amp; Help</a> section below. If you find that a mod is dirty, you should also report this to the mod's author so that they can fix it.
<p><b>Note:</b> TES4Edit et al. will include a variety of <em>junk records</em> in the ITM count for a plugin, such as new empty cells that are automatically generated by the Construction Set and are almost impossible to remove. These junk records are non-harmful, and BOSS will inform users when a mod contains these to avoid confusion. This is also the source of any discrepancies between the counts produced by TES4Edit and those produced by <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>. The latter's counts are more technically accurate, but both are acceptable for use.
<p>There is also another type of unnecessary edit, known as a wild edit, that can also cause problems. These edits are neither Identical To Master edits nor deleted records, so cannot be automatically cleaned. Cleaning must be manually done in TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit. BOSS can still check for plugins with these edits if the CRCs of the plugins with wild edits are known, and it can provide notification of these edits and some information on fixing them if they are reported in an official BOSS thread.

<h3 id="falseflags">False-Flagged Plugins</h3>
<p>Whether a mod plugin is a master file or a non-master file is dependent not on its file extension (<code>.esp</code>, <code>.esm</code>), but is instead decided by the value of a setting inside the plugin file, known as its <q>master bit flag</q>. Master files have this set to <code>1</code>, and non-master files have it set to <code>0</code>. However, because ESM is an acronym for <q>Elder Scrolls Master</q>, and ESP is an acronym for <q>Elder Scrolls Plugin</q> (even for Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas), most people assume that master plugins are files with <code>.esm</code> extensions, while non-master plugins are files with <code>.esp</code> extensions.
<p>This assumption is valid for the most part, as the vast majority of masters are <code>.esm</code> files, and the vast majority of plugins are <code>.esp</code> files. However, sometimes this is not the case. When a plugin has a <code>.esm</code> extension but has a master bit flag value of <code>0</code>, or has an extension of <code>.esp</code> and a master bit flag value of <code>1</code>, the plugin is said to be <q>false-flagged</q>, as its extension does not match its master bit flag value. False-flagged plugins are most common in Fallout 3 due to the use of FO3Edit's <q>Master Update</q> feature, which turns non-master plugins into false-flagged plugins, to avoid bugs that only manifest for non-master plugins.
<p>The distinction between masters and non-masters is important for load order because the game will always load all masters before all non-masters, regardless of whether they are listed or dated (depending on your game) as such by the mechanism used to determine load order. Earlier versions of BOSS, and most if not all mod managers, put all <code>.esm</code> files before all <code>.esp</code> files, but failed to take into account the value of the master bit flag of plugins. As such, the load order they displayed was incorrect, as it failed to take into account the game always loading masters before plugins.
<p>Since the master bit flag can be changed by users, it is not sufficient to update the masterlists to take into account the values of plugin master bit flags in the plugins available for download, as the user may have changed the master bit flag values (eg. using FO3Edit's Master Update). As such, BOSS instead checks that the masterlist used is ordering masters before non-masters, and moves any masters loading after non-masters so that they load before non-masters. If any masters are moved, it then displays a message in the BOSS Log to notify the user of this change. The BOSS Log does not detail which masters were moved.

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Although BOSS is simple to use, it has grown to become a relatively complex application. As such, there are some circumstances under which BOSS may not be able to run correctly, due to a variety of possible reasons. In such cases, an error message detailing the problem should be provided. If the program unexpectedly crashes, or you experience 
a problem for which no error message is given, please report the crash or problem to an official BOSS thread (linked to in the <a href="#links">Quick Links</a> section below), so that we may fix it.
<p>If the information below does not help you to solve any problems you are experiencing, please seek further support in one of the official BOSS threads.
<h3 id="general-issues">General Problems</h3>
<p>There are a few general reasons why BOSS may fail to function correctly. Check if any of the symptoms listed below fit your issue.
<ul class="errorMessages">
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> No change in load order.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>'s <q>Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously Lock Times">*</span> load order locking feature is enabled, but <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> is not.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Enable <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>'s <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> setting.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> You are running BOSS for Skyrim and checking the load order using a utility that has not been updated to work with Skyrim's textfile-based load order system.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Update your utility to a version that works with the textfile-based load order system, or use Skyrim's launcher to view load order. Editing load order in Skyrim's launcher is not recommended as it does not record load order data for inactive plugins.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> When viewing load order in Skyrim's launcher, some plugins are deactivated and moved to the bottom of the list.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS lists plugins in load order using their names in the masterlist, which can be in the wrong case. Skyrim's launcher is case-sensitive when it reads load order, so any plugins listed with incorrect cases will be removed from the load order. Skyrim itself is case-agnostic, so will load plugins listed with incorrect cases.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Report the deactivated plugins with their correct cases to the BOSS Development Team so that the case in the masterlist can be corrected.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not recognise the plugins in my userlist correctly, and/or replaces some of the letters in their names with question marks.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Your userlist is not encoded in UTF-8.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Save your userlist in the UTF-8 encoding.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> You had plugins in your userlist with non-Latin letters in their names, and saved your userlist in a non-UTF8 encoding before saving it in UTF-8.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Rewrite the filenames in your userlist, copy/pasting them from the files themselves to ensure they are correct.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> Some plugins have the wrong or no version number given in the BOSS Log.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> This occurs because BOSS looks for the version number in the plugin's description field. If the plugin author has forgotten to update the version number there or not provided one, an incorrect or no version number will be displayed.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> No solution, other than the plugin author including a correct version number in the plugin's description field for a later release.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> You get an error message of the form <q>There is a problem sending the command to the program.</q>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> This is a Windows error unrelated to BOSS that may occur when it tries to open your BOSS Log (or another file, but most commonly reported for the BOSS Log).
		<li><b>Solution:</b> The exact cause is unknown, but make sure that you have the default program for HTML files set to your web browser, using the Control Panel settings. If your default program is set correctly, then restarting your computer will probably fix the issue.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> The BOSS Log labels plugins as active incorrectly on Windows Vista or Windows 7.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> For some reason BOSS is finding it difficult to read which of your plugins are active, due to a lack of permissions.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Running BOSS as an Administrator will allow it to read which of your plugins are active properly.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> Skyrim is installed, but BOSS cannot detect it when installed non-locally.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> The Registry entry for your Skyrim install is missing. This can occur if Steam's <q>Verify Integrity Of Game Cache</q> function is used.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Running Skyrim's launcher will add the Registry entry back in, allowing BOSS to detect Skyrim correctly.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> The BOSS Log keeps displaying a <q>Browser Compatibility</q> panel when it opens.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Not an issue. This is done so that you know what features you can and cannot access with the browser you are using to view the BOSS Log.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> You can choose to prevent the panel from displaying if your browser supports the Web Storage API. If you don't see a checkbox labelled <q>Do not display this panel again for this browser.</q>, you need to upgrade your browser.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> The BOSS Log says my browser supports the <q>Settings Memory</q> functionality, but all my settings have been lost!
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Settings are stored in your browser's application cache, which is emptied when your browsing data is cleared.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> No solution, as BOSS has no control over how the settings are stored, but you can back up and restore your CSS settings quickly and easily if your browser supports the feature, or simply take a note of your custom colours, and setting your filters and collapsed sections up again takes seconds.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="permissions">File Permissions</h3>
<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:
<ol>
	<li>Install the game outside the <q>Program Files</q> (or <q>Program Files (x86)</q> if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.
	<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.
	<li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.
	<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the <q>BOSS.exe</q> and <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>, and select <q>Run as administrator</q>.
</ol>
<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.
	<li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.
	<li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.
	<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.
	<li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.
</ol>

<h3 id="international">International Character Support</h3>
<p>BOSS provides support for sorting plugins containing characters from any language via the Unicode character encoding, specifically UTF-8. All BOSS's files are encoded in UTF-8 by default. However, if you created your userlist.txt before BOSS automatically created one, you will probably need to convert it to the UTF-8 encoding, as it is not Notepad's default encoding. Below are some instructions for converting a file's encoding to UTF-8:
<ul>
	<li>Using Notepad:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
	<li>Using Notepad++:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad++.
			<li>Open the <q>Encoding</q> menu, then select <q>Convert to UTF-8</q>.
			<li>Save the file as normal.
		</ol>
</ul>
<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it. 

<h3 id="errors">Error Messages</h3>
<p>If BOSS can detect a specific reason for being unable to function correctly, it will print an error message detailing the problem. BOSS's error messages are listed below, along with details of the issues and possible solutions.
<ul class="errorMessages">
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>No game detected!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Your master .ESM file is deactivated and ghosted by <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-activate your master .ESM file.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS cannot detect any of the supported games.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Install BOSS locally for each of the supported games you have installed. I.e. have a BOSS folder sitting next to the Data folder of each game.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS cannot tell what game it is running for.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> This may occur if BOSS has been unable to detect a supported game but it is made to run anyway, eg. by running the GUI with <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> selected but the <q>Active Game</q> set to <q>None</q>. Make sure that you have selected a game to run for or set the active game.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be read!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If <code>filename</code> is the masterlist, ensure that the masterlist updater is enabled and run BOSS again to download the masterlist to the correct location.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure <code>filename</code> exists, and that you have read permissions for the file and its parent folders.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be written to!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to <code>filename</code> if it exists.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" is not encoded in valid UTF-8!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> If <code>filename</code> is "userlist.txt", BOSS has detected that your userlist.txt is saved using the wrong encoding, and is unable to read it.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save the file given in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. If you are unsure on how to do so, follow these instructions:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
		<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.
		
		<li><b>Issue:</b> If <code>filename</code> is not "userlist.txt", BOSS is not functioning correctly.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save <code>filename</code> in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. Report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be found!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure <code>filename</code> exists. If <code>filename</code> is a BOSS Log and you are trying to open it from the GUI, make sure that you have run BOSS at least once	with it set to generate the format of BOSS Log you are trying to view.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>Master files loading after non-master plugins!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS is trying to set master plugins after non-master plugins in the load order. This won't break anything, because the game always loads masters before non-masters regardless of their load order, but it means that BOSS's output would be incorrect.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If you have ESMified any non-master plugins, ESPify them back again before running BOSS. If you have not ESMified any non-master plugins, or don't know what that means, report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>This plugin's internal master bit flag value does not match its file extension. This issue should be reported to the mod's author, and can be fixed by changing the file extension from .esp to .esm or vice versa.</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Whether a plugin is a master file or not is not decided by its file extension, but rather by a bit flag within the plugin. Some mod authors do not know this and so attempt to turn plugins into masters or masters into plugins by changing the file's extension. This does not work, and the game will only pay attention to the bit flag value, so it can appear to users that the plugin is loading in one position when it is actually loading on another. BOSS checks for such <i>false-flagged</i> plugins and alerts the user.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Contact the mod author notifying them of the issue politely. The bit flag of a plugin can be changed using Wrye Bash's <q>ESMify/ESPify Self</q> functionality.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>Cannot find online masterlist revision number!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>Cannot find online masterlist revision date!</i>
	<ul>

	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>Cannot read list of files to be updated!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>Downloaded file "<code>filename</code>" failed verification test!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> <code>filename</code> was corrupted during download or the download did otherwise not complete properly.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Try updating again.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>The modification date of "<code>filename</code>" cannot be read! Filesystem response: "<code>further details</code>".</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure <code>filename</code> exists, and that you have read permissions for the file and its parent folders.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be renamed! Filesystem response: "<code>further details</code>".</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be deleted! Filesystem response: "<code>further details</code>".</i>

	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that you have read permissions for the location that is being scanned. See the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>cURL cannot be initialised!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> The program that BOSS uses to connect to the Internet could not be initialised.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> No specific solution. Try again later.

	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>The modification date of "<code>filename</code>" cannot be written!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>No Internet connection detected.</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If you are certain that you do have an Internet connection, it could be because you use a proxy to connect to the Internet. Enter your proxy connection details into the relevant parts of the <q>BOSS.ini</q> and try again. 
		If you are unsure whether you are using a proxy and are trying to use BOSS in an enterprise environment, contact your network administrator for your proxy details. If you continue to have difficulty or are not using a proxy, report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.

The documents covered by the latter license are <q>BOSS ReadMe.html</q>, <q>BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html</q>, <q>BOSS API ReadMe.html</q> and <q>BOSS Masterlist Syntax.html</q>. For the full text of both licenses, see the included <q>Licenses.txt</q> file.

<p>While the GPL license allows anyone to make derivative works of BOSS, the BOSS Development Team encourages those thinking of doing so to first discuss their reasoning for such an endevour with the Team. It may be that what the derivative work would do differently from BOSS itself is already planned for a future version of BOSS or would be happily integrated into BOSS by the Team, thus avoiding any extra effort by others.
<p>The BOSS Team also appeals to the community to avoid the distribution and development of alternative masterlists, as this would only hamper the community effort to create one universally-optimised load order for all plugins available for download. Any issues with a masterlist are best brought to the attention of the BOSS Team so that we may remedy them ourselves.
