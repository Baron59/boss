<h2 id="features">Features &amp; Introduction</h2>
<ul>
	<li>Correctly positions over 22,100 mod plugins and counting for TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Nehrim - At Fate's Edge.
	<ul><li>Over 13,300 / 2,500 / 3,100 / 3,100 / 180 mod plugins respectively.</ul>
	<li>Provides a large number of usage notes for many plugins, including requirements, incompatibilities, updates and bug warnings.
	<li>Provides detection and warning of installation mistakes for some popular mods.
	<li>Displays the version number of plugins when it is available.

	<li>Includes a semi-automatic updater to ensure that the latest version is always installed.
	<li>Is under constant development and improvement by a team of modders and experts on all supported games.
</ul>
<p>BOSS will re-order your mod plugins to their correct positions, putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.
<p>BOSS is designed to assist in the usage of mods, helping mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for the relevant game is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.

<h2 id="install">Installation &amp; Basic Usage</h2>
<p><b>Note that BOSS does not support Windows 2000 or earlier.</b>
<p>BOSS can be installed for use with TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas and Nehrim - At Fate's Edge (a Total Conversion mod for Oblivion). Installation may either be automated, using the BOSS Installer package, or manually, using the archive package. Either method is simple, and instructions for manual installation are given below.
<ol>
	<li>If upgrading from an earlier version of BOSS, delete all BOSS files and folders in all supported games' Data folders. Also delete any of the following from your BOSS folder(s) (but not from any folders within your BOSS folders): BOSSlog.txt; BOSSlog.html; masterlist.txt; modlist.txt; modlist.old. 
	<ul><li>If you have existing userlists, you will need to move them into the subfolders BOSS creates for their games in the BOSS folder when it is run. The installer does this automatically for you.</ul>
	<li>Within the archive you downloaded there is a BOSS folder. Extract this folder to a location of your choice. Make sure that you have the appropriate file permissions for the directory you choose. See the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section for more information.
	<ul>
		<li>If you only have one BOSS-supported game installed, it is best to install BOSS to the game's installation directory (ie. one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q>, <q>fallout new vegas</q> or <q>skyrim</q> depending on the game), so that the BOSS folder sits alongside the Data folder and the game's executable. This is referred to as a local install. BOSS by default will always run for the local game.
		<li>If you have more than one BOSS-supported game installed, it is best to install BOSS to a location outside of the supported games' installation directories. This is referred to as a non-local install. In a non-local install, BOSS by default lets the user choose which game to run for. This is the default install type when installing BOSS using the installer.
		<li>If you have multiple copies of the same game installed, then you must also copy the BOSS folder you installed to each instance of that game, apart from the original install, so that it is installed locally for each copy. These copies act as totally separate installs of BOSS, independent of each other and the 'main' BOSS install.
	</ul>
	<li>If any of the <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities are installed, make sure their <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> setting is enabled.
	<li>In the BOSS folder, run <q>BOSS.exe</q>. This will download the latest masterlist from the Internet and then sort your mods.
</ol>
<p>Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. The <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> utilities will automatically import and apply Bash Tag suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> if necessary.
<p>Unrecognised mods must be re-ordered by hand using <abbr title="Oblivion Mod Manager">OBMM</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Mod Manager">FOMM</abbr> or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>.

<h2 id="remove">Uninstallation</h2>
<p>If BOSS was installed using the installer, then use the uninstaller it provides a link to in the Start Menu to uninstall BOSS. If BOSS was installed manually, do the following:
<ol><li>Delete the BOSS folder in the location you installed it to. If you installed BOSS to more than one location, delete each BOSS folder for each install of BOSS you wish to remove.</ol>

<h2 id="general">General Usage</h2>
<p>This section gives more information on the parts of BOSS's functionality that users are likely to come into contact with during the course of general usage of BOSS. It gives details on the capabilities of the GUI, information on how to keep BOSS up to date, information on the BOSS Log and its constituent parts, and provides some background information and BOSS-specific notes on the subject of dirty edits and mod cleaning.
<h3 id="gui">The Graphical User Interface</h3>
<p>While the <abbr title="Command Line Interface">CLI</abbr> provided by <q>BOSS.exe</q> offers the simplest way to run BOSS using just one click, the <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> provided by <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> provides a way of accessing BOSS's options, settings and more powerful features without having to edit any other files manually. The CLI and GUI both possess the same core functionality, but differ in how they approach providing it, with the CLI being text-based and the GUI using graphical elements such as buttons, checkboxes and drop-down lists.
<p>The GUI is composed of three windows: the Main window, which is the one displayed when the GUI is run; the Settings window; and the User Rules Editor window. Their content shall be explained in turn.

<h4>The Main Window</h4>
<figure>
<img alt="main window" src="images/BOSS%20GUI%20Main.png"/>
<figcaption>The BOSS GUI's main window, containing the most commonly used options.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The title bar of the main window displays which game BOSS is running for: this may also be checked by seeing which game is selected in the <q>Active Game</q> menu.
<p>The menu bar holds four menus: <q>File</q>, <q>Edit</q>, <q>Active Game</q> and <q>Help</q>. The <q>File</q> menu just contains commands for opening the BOSS Log, running BOSS and quitting. The <q>Edit</q> menu contains a command for editing user rules, which works the same as the <q>Edit User Rules</q> button, and a command for opening the settings window. The <q>Help</q> menu contains links to BOSS's documentation and copyright licenses, and commands to view the <q>About</q> dialog and to check for updates to the BOSS program (see the <a href="#updates">Keeping BOSS Up-To-Date</a> section for details).
<p>The <q>Active Game</q> menu allows you to change which game BOSS is running for without closing and re-opening the GUI. Games that BOSS does not detect as being installed are greyed out. The active game is marked with a dot next to it. To change the active game, simply select another game in the list. Setting the run type to <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> will un-grey all the games, allowing any of them to be selected, while changing from <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> to another run type will grey out undetected games again. If an undetected game is active when you change run type, BOSS will automatically switch to the first detected game in the list. If BOSS fails to detect any supported games, the active game will be set to <q>None</q> and the <q>Sort Plugins</q> and <q>Undo Changes</q> run types will be greyed out. You may then select a game from the <q>Active Game</q> menu to update its masterlist only. See <a href="#special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</a> for when this may be useful.
<p>The output options on the left of the window tweak settings related to the BOSS Log. When the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option is enabled, the BOSS Log displays the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in the Data folder, and of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Skyrim Script Extender">SKSE</abbr> and its installed plugins if present. The <q>BOSS Log Format</q> option decides both what format of BOSS Log is generated when BOSS is run and what format of BOSS Log the GUI opens when the <q>View BOSS Log</q> button or <q>File&#x2192;View BOSS Log</q> menu item is selected. <q>Display Plugin Versions</q> and <q>Show BOSS Log On Completion</q> do exactly as they say on the tin.
<p>The run options on the right of the main window decide how BOSS runs. BOSS has three main modes of operation that are mutually exclusive to one another: it can either sort your plugins, only update your masterlist then quit or undo its changes to your load order. When <q>Update Masterlist</q> is enabled, BOSS will update your masterlist before sorting your plugins. When <q>Perform Trial Run</q> is enabled, BOSS simulates its changes to your load order without actually reordering your mods. The <q>Undo Level</q> option allows you to select how many runs of BOSS are to be undone.
<p>The <q>Edit User Rules</q> button opens your userlist for editing. If the <q>Use User Rules Editor</q> setting in the Settings window is enabled, clicking the button will open the User Rules Editor window, otherwise it will open your userlist in your default text editor. The <q>Run BOSS</q> button runs BOSS's main sorting/updating/undoing functionality according to the options selected. The <q>View BOSS Log</q> button does exactly what it says on the tin, opening the BOSS Log in the format selected in the Output Options section.

<h4>The Settings Window</h4>

<figcaption>The 5 tabs of the GUI's settings window, containing the various settings not displayed in the main window (animated slideshow).</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>BOSS has a large number of settings, only a few of which can be displayed in the main window. As such, the less commonly used settings are found in the Settings window, which can be accessed by clicking <q>Edit&#x2192;Settings...</q> in the main window's menu bar. The settings are grouped into tabs depending on what area of BOSS's behaviour they control. The settings are detailed in the table below.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Tab<td>Setting<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td rowspan="3">General<td>Check for BOSS updates on startup<td>Controls whether or not BOSS checks for program (not masterlist) updates automatically when it starts up.
		<tr><td>Use User Rules Editor<td>Controls whether the GUI uses the User Rules Editor window to edit user rules or whether it opens the userlist.txt for manual editing.
		<tr><td>Default Game<td>If set to something other than <q>Autodetect</q>, this overrides game autodetection. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS falls back to autodetection, unless BOSS is run with the <q>Masterlist Update Only</q> option selected, in which case BOSS will run successfully whether or not the game is installed.
		<tr><td rowspan="4">Internet<td>Proxy Hostname<td>If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, specify its hostname here.
		<tr><td>Proxy Port Number<td>If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, specify its port number here.
		<tr><td>Proxy Username<td>If you use a proxy that requires authentication to connect to the Internet, specify your username here.
		<tr><td>Proxy Password<td>If you use a proxy that requires authentication to connect to the Internet, specify your password here.
		<tr><td rowspan="3">Debugging<td>Debug Outout Verbosity<td>The verbosity of the debug output. As values increase, so does verbosity, 'Standard (0)' displays only warning and error messages.
		<tr><td>Include Source Code References<td>Add source code references to the debug output.
		<tr><td>Log Debug Output<td>Save the debug output to a <q>BOSSDebugLog.txt</q> text file.
		<tr><td>BOSS Log Filters<td><i>Many</i><td>These settings control the default states of the BOSS Log filters. If a setting's box is checked, then the filter of the same name in the BOSS Log will be enabled when the BOSS Log is opened. See the <a href="#bosslog">The BOSS Log</a> section below for what each filter does.
		<tr><td>BOSS Log CSS<td><i>Many</i><td>These settings control the BOSS Log's CSS styles, used to provide the formatting for the BOSS Log. A knowledge of CSS is expected if you wish to alter these settings. If you do not possess such knowledge, altering these settings is not recommended. The CSS selectors are given on the left, and their styling can be edited in the corresponding text boxes on the right. Curly brackets should be omitted.
</table>
<p>Each setting in the GUI corresponds to a command line parameter and/or an ini setting, the details of which can be found in the <a href="#cli">Command Line Arguments</a> and <a href="#customising">Customising How BOSS Works</a> sections of this ReadMe respectively.

<h4>The User Rules Editor</h4>
<figure>
<img alt="user rules editor window" src="images/BOSS%20GUI%20User%20Rules%20Editor.png"/>
<figcaption>The User Rules Editor, a graphical interface for managing your user rules.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The User Rules Editor can be used instead of editing your userlist.txt directly. The information contained within the <a href="BOSS%20User%20Rules%20ReadMe.html">BOSS User Rules ReadMe</a> document is still required to understand user rules. The editor comprises of the following elements:
<ul>
	<li>User Rules:
	<ul>
		<li>This section lists your user rules in order. 
		<li>Rules that are currently enabled have their checkboxes checked, whereas disabled rules are unchecked.
		<li>Rules can be moved up or down using the <q>Move Rule Up</q> and <q>Move Rule Down</q> buttons at the bottom of the window.
		<li>When the User Rules Editor is loaded, it will automatically disable any rules adding mods that are already in the masterlist.
	</ul>
	<li>Installed Mods/Masterlist tabs:
	<ul>
		<li>The Installed Mods tab lists the plugins found in your Data folder. Plugins are listed in the order that they are loaded. All plugins installed are displayed, not just those in your currently active load order.
		<li>The Masterlist tab displays the masterlist as a tree list, showing plugins and groups. The tree list is by default fully collapsed. Double clicking on a collapsed group (any row without a <code>.esp</code> or <code>.esm</code> in its name) will expand that group, showing its children. Double clicking an expanded group will collapse it again, hiding its children.
		<li>Selecting a plugin in the Masterlist tab's list will cause the messages attached to it by the masterlist to be displayed in the Masterlist Mod Messages section.
		<li>Either list may be searched using the search box at the top of each tab. Searching looks for matches from the start of plugin and group names, searching for <code>xul</code> would return all plugins and groups with names that start with <code>xul</code>. Searches are performed when the <q>Enter</q> keyboard key is pressed, and may be cancelled by clicking the grey cross that appears in the search box.
		<li>A plugin or group may be selected frm either list and drag 'n' dropped into a text box in the Rule Creator/Editor to add that plugin or group to the text box, rather than having to write out its name.
	</ul>
	<li>Masterlist Mod Messages:
	<ul>
		<li>This section displays the messages attached to the currently selected mod in the Masterlist section. The messages are displayed as they appear in the masterlist, not as they appear in the BOSS Log. See the <a href="BOSS%20User%20Rules%20ReadMe.html">BOSS User Rules ReadMe</a> for a brief overview of the most common message syntax, and the <a href="BOSS%20Masterlist%20Syntax.html">BOSS Masterlist Syntax</a> documentation for the full details.
		<li>The messages cannot be edited here: they must be replaced or added to via a user rule in the Rule Creator/Editor.
	</ul>
	<li>Rule Creator/Editor:
	<ul>
		<li>This section is where the user edits or creates user rules. Selecting a rule in the User Rules list will load it into this section.
		<li>The <em>rule object</em> is specified in the first text box. This is the plugin or group that the rule acts upon.
		<li>If the rule object is to be sorted, the object it is sorted relative to must be specified in one of the two text boxes in the Sort Item subsection, depending whether the user is sorting the object relative to another, or inserting a mod into a group.
		<li>Messages for addition or to replace existing messages should be written in the large text box. They must use valid syntax.
		<li>To add the current contents of the Rule Creator/Editor as a new rule, use the <q>Create New Rule</q> button. To save edits to the selected rule in the User Rules list, use the <q>Save Edited Rule</q> button. The User Rules Editor will ask for confirmation before applying the edits.
		<li>To delete the rule selected in the User Rules list, use the <q>Delete Rule</q> button. The User Rules Editor will ask for confirmation before deleting the rule.
		<li>The User Rules Editor will catch most, if not all, syntax errors in created and edited rules and warn the user of the errors encountered. No invalid rules will be saved.
	</ul>
</ul>
<p>To save your changes to your userlist and exit, use the <q>Save</q> button. To exit without saving, use the <q>Cancel</q> button.
<p>Plugins and groups may be added to the text boxes in the Rule Creator by dragging and dropping them from the Installed Mods and Masterlist lists on the right of the window. Dropping a plugin or group into a text box currently containing a plugin or group will cause the existing text to be replaced.</p>
<p>The User Rules Editor ignores all silent comments in your userlist.txt, and will strip them from the file if you choose to save your user rules via the editor.

<h3 id="updates">Keeping BOSS Up-To-Date</h3>
<p>It is important that you keep your BOSS installation updated, not only to benefit from the many frequent updates made to the masterlists, but also to benefit from bug fixes, improvements and new features introduced to new releases of BOSS itself.
<p>Providing there is an Internet connection available when BOSS runs, it will automatically download and apply any updates available for the masterlist of the game it is running for by default. BOSS will also check for new releases and if an update is available it will notify the user, displaying release notes if any are available. Additionally, if you installed BOSS using the automated installer, BOSS will ask the user if they wish to update, and automatically download and run the updated version's installer if so. The check for new releases functionality behaves as outlined below:
<ol>
 <li>On launching, it automatically checks for updates to BOSS. If an update is found, it proceeds to the next step. If no update is available, or no Internet connection is present, it will display no message.
 <ul>
  <li>If you run the <q>Check For Updates</q> option from the GUI's Help option, then it will display messages detailing if no update was found or if there were any errors.
 </ul>
 <li>No matter how the update check was started, if an update is available it will notify the user, asking whether or not to download and install the update if BOSS was installed using the automated installer. If the user decides not to update, the updater will quit.
 <li>If the user decides to update, then it will begin downloading the new installer to the BOSS folder, displaying the progress. If using the GUI, the download can be cancelled at any time, in which case any downloaded file will be deleted and the updater will quit. CLI users can cancel the download by quitting BOSS, but no cleanup will take place.
</ol>
<p>Under certain circumstances the masterlist and program updaters may be unable to function fully. If you have issues using them, see the <a href="#special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</a> section for alternative methods.

<p>BOSS program updates are also published at the
<a href="http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516">TES Nexus</a>, 
<a href="http://www.skyrimnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=6">Skyrim Nexus</a>,
<a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193">Fallout 3 Nexus</a> and 
<a href="http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999">New Vegas Nexus</a> BOSS pages. For those not using the masterlist updater, the latest masterlist is always on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/">Google Code repository</a>.
<p>Always make sure to use the latest version of BOSS and the latest masterlist.

<h3 id="bosslog">The BOSS Log</h3>
<p>The BOSS Log is where you will find all of BOSS's outputted information. It can be generated in either HTML format (the default) or as a plain text file with minimal formatting. The HTML format has significant advantages over the plain text format, being considerably easier to read, containing colour-coded messages and a variety of filters to customise what is displayed. However, other than the HTML BOSS Log providing a notification if there has been no change in the recognised mod list since last run, there is no difference in information provided between the two formats.
<p>The HTML BOSS Log has been tested in Mozilla Firefox 10, Google Chrome 17, Opera 11 and Internet Explorer 9. Using earlier browsers may result in parts of the BOSS Log not working or displaying correctly.
<p>The BOSS Log comprises of a number of sections, which are detailed in the table below.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>BOSS Log Section<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>General Messages<td>This section is only displayed if there are any applicable messages to be displayed. Its primary purpose is to allow BOSS to display messages specific to your Oblivion install that are not specific to any one mod. Parser and updater error messages are also displayed in this section.
		<tr><td>Summary<td>This section gives a short summary of BOSS's actions. It breaks down the numbers of plugins installed and messages attached to them and gives the local masterlist version and whether or not it was updated. If the BOSS Log is in the HTML format it will also display a message if your recognised plugin list has not changed since you last ran BOSS.
		<tr><td>Userlist Messages<td>This section is only displayed if BOSS finds any user rules in your userlist. It details the successes or failures of the application of your userlist rules.
		<tr><td>Script Extender And Script Extender Plugins<td>This section is displayed if you have your game's Script Extender installed. It will list the Script Extender and any plugins for it that you have installed, displaying their versions (if given) and their CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled).
		<tr><td>Recognised And Re-ordered Plugins<td>This section comprises the bulk of BOSS's output, listing all your recognised installed plugins and any messages BOSS has attached to them, as well as version information (if given) and the plugin CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled). 
		<tr><td>Restored Load Order<td>This section is only displayed when BOSS is run to undo its changes, and lists your restored load order.
		<tr><td>Unrecognised Plugins<td>This section is only displayed if you have plugins installed that are unrecognised by BOSS, and lists them. These plugins should be reported in an official BOSS thread with download links to their mods so they can be added to the relevant masterlist.
</table>
<p>BOSS will display the version numbers of any plugins that provide them in their description fields. If a plugin supplies no version number, it cannot be displayed. The version numbers may not reflect the actual version of the mod installed - this could either be due to the mod author forgetting to update the description, or due to a mistake in BOSS's detection. As version numbers are supplied by mod authors in a wide range of formats and BOSS has to detect as many as possible, it occasionally identifies parts of some descriptions as version numbers incorrectly. This is largely unavoidable, but any discrepancies should be reported to the BOSS team in case they can be fixed. When in doubt, check the version number given in a mod's readme. 
<p>It should be noted that the vast majority of BOSS's mod messages are non-conditional, in that they are not displayed in response to your specific install. For example, a message that gives some of the mod's incompatibilities does not know if you have them installed or not, and a message telling you to do something will not know if it has been done.
<p>BOSS's mod messages are one of the most important features BOSS provides, acting as a means of providing users with information that they might otherwise not obtain. It is important for a stable, healthy game that you act on any messages that require action. If you think a message suggests an action that is not necessary, report it to an official BOSS thread.
<p>The HTML BOSS Log includes a few features and a number of filters to customise what is displayed. The majority of these are found in the shaded box near the top of the BOSS Log, and are enabled and disabled via their checkboxes:

<p>The number of plugins and messages hidden at any one time are displayed below the filters box in italics. In addition to the above filters, clicking on a section's title will collapse that section, hiding its contents. Clicking the title again will expand the section, making its contents visible again.
<p>It is not possible to hide mod warning or error messages, as these are of a severity where they should almost certainly be acted upon, and not ignored. Be aware that if you hide all a mod's messages and then hide all messageless mods, that mod will be amongst those hidden.

<h3 id="dirtymods">Dirty Edits, Mod Cleaning &amp; CRCs</h3>
<p>Dirty edits are often a side-effect of mod creation, and are often due to bugs in the utilities Bethesda has provided to create mods, rather than bad practice by mod authors. Dirty edits can cause a wide range of issues, including incorrect game settings, missing content, broken quests and crashing to desktop. The more dirty edits there are, and the more mods with dirty edits you use, the more likely you are to experience issues.
<p>Thankfully there is a way to remove dirty edits from mods relatively easily, a process known as <i>mod cleaning</i>, using TES4Edit (for Oblivion), FO3Edit (for Fallout 3), FNVEdit (for Fallout: New Vegas) or TES5Edit (for Skyrim). A detailed set of instructions and information on mod cleaning can be found on the CS Wiki's <a href="http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/TES4Edit_Cleaning_Guide">TES4Edit Cleaning Guide</a> (the page also applies to Fallout 3 Fallout: New Vegas and Skyrim). <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> can also scan plugins for dirty edits and return their ITM and UDR counts, though at the time of writing it cannot clean plugins itself.
<p>The problem of dirty edits is largely a problem of ignorance on the part of mod authors and users alike of the problems unclean mods (more widely known as <i>dirty mods</i>) can cause. As such, there are community efforts to raise awareness of dirty edits and cleaning. BOSS plays a key role in these efforts, as it holds the complete list of all known dirty mods, and it uses this information to provide notification messages to users for any dirty mods they have installed.
There are three key pieces of information that are used to accurately describe and identify an unclean mod. They are:
<ul>
	<li><i>ITM Count</i>: ITM (Identical To Master) records are a type of dirty edit where a mod has overwritten something in the game without actually changing anything. If another mod lower in the load order makes an intentional change to that thing, it will have its effect cancelled out by the ITM record, which can cause problems. The ITM count is the number of ITM records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i>UDR Count</i>: Deleting records is a significant cause of crashes and game bugs. UDR (Undeleted and Disabled Reference) records are records that the mod deleted from the game or from another mod that have been corrected safely by undeleting them and disabling them instead, which has the same intended effect without causing issues. The UDR count is the number of deleted reference records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i>CRC</i> or <i>Checksum</i>: A file's CRC is a highly accurate way of identifying it, and is a number calculated from the file's contents. If the contents of a file changes, so will its CRC. BOSS uses CRCs to check if a user's mods are dirty by checking their CRCs against pre-determined CRCs of known dirty mods. This lets BOSS give precise notification messages for any dirty mods it detects. BOSS can calculate the CRCs of all your installed plugins if run from the GUI with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled.
</ul>
<p>However, not all unclean mods have all or any of these pieces of information. For unclean mods whose ITM and UDR counts have not been reported, BOSS cannot give them. For unclean mods whose CRCs have not been reported, BOSS cannot give precise notification and so prints a message whether or not the user has cleaned their mod.
<p>BOSS and the modding communities rely on user contribution of this information to progress. For information on how to contribute, see the <a href="#help">Contributions &amp; Help</a> section below. If you find that a mod is dirty, you should also report this to the mod's author so that they can fix it.
<p><b>Note:</b> TES4Edit et al. will include a variety of <em>junk records</em> in the ITM count for a plugin, such as new empty cells that are automatically generated by the Construction Set and are almost impossible to remove. These junk records are non-harmful, and BOSS will inform users when a mod contains these to avoid confusion. This is also the source of any discrepancies between the counts produced by TES4Edit and those produced by <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>. The latter's counts are more technically accurate, but both are acceptable for use.
<p>There is also another type of unnecessary edit, known as a wild edit, that can also cause problems. These edits are neither Itentical To Master edits nor deleted records, so cannot be automatically cleaned. Cleaning must be manually done in TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit. BOSS can still check for plugins with these edits if the CRCs of the plugins with wild edits are known, and it can provide notification of these edits and some information on fixing them if they are reported in an official BOSS thread.


<h2 id="help">Contributions &amp; Help</h2>
<p>General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised or unclean plugins, takes place in BOSS's official threads for

<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.
<p>Lists of unrecognised plugins are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>A link to where the description, mod or readme can be found to read or download.
	<li>A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.
</ul>
<p>Lists of unclean plugins are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The CRC(s) of the unlcean ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the uncleaned files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr> or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the <q>CRC checksum for data</q> is the one required.
</ul>

<h2 id="advanced">Advanced Usage</h2>
<p>This section gives information on how to operate BOSS under certain conditions, how to customise its behaviour more fully than previously covered, and provides details for all the BOSS files.

<h3 id="userRules">User Rules</h3>
<p>Users can customise how BOSS handles their plugins through the included User Rules feature. This feature allows you to define the positions of plugins not in the masterlist, and to override the masterlist positions of plugins, as well as edit the output messages of plugins, and more. In addition, this is all done without editing the masterlist.txt, so when you update it using the built-in updater, your changes are not lost. All the information on the User Rules feature can be found in the <a href="BOSS%20User%20Rules%20ReadMe.html">BOSS User Rules ReadMe</a> file that accompanies this ReadMe.

<h3 id="ini">The BOSS.ini</h3>
<p>Users can edit all of BOSS's settings in the BOSS.ini. As this is where BOSS gets its settings from when both running the CLI client and when loading the GUI client, care must be taken to edit it correctly to prevent breaking BOSS's operation. If BOSS is run and it cannot find a BOSS.ini, it will generate a new one with default settings. If BOSS is run with both a BOSS.ini present and command line parameters set, the command line parameters override the settings in BOSS.ini. The ini is split into the following sections:
<h4>BOSS.GeneralSettings</h4>
<p>These settings control miscellaneous areas of BOSS's operation outside of the main sorting functionality.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>bDoStartupUpdateCheck<td><code>true</code><td><code>true</code>, <code>false</code><td>Controls whether or not BOSS's Automatic Updater checks for new releases when BOSS is run.
		<tr><td>bUseUserRulesEditor<td><code>true</code><td><code>true</code>, <code>false</code><td>Controls whether the GUI uses the User Rules Editor window to edit user rules or whether it opens the userlist.txt for manual editing.
</table>
<h4>BOSS.InternetSettings</h4>
<p>These settings control how the masterlist updater and GUI auto-updater connect to the Internet. They are shared by BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe, and can be overriden for the masterlist updater using BOSS's command line parameters. They may also be edited through the GUI. You will probably know if you need to alter them.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>sProxyHostname<td>Default is an empty string.<td>An empty string, hostname (eg. <code>proxy.company.com</code>), IP address (eg. <code>192.168.32.4</code>)<td>The hostname for the proxy host used, if a proxy is required to connect to the Internet. If no hostname is given, BOSS assumes that no proxy should be used.
		<tr><td>iProxyPort<td><code>0</code><td>Any valid port number.<td>The port used to connect to the proxy host, if a proxy is required to connect to the Internet. <code>0</code> tells BOSS to use no proxy.
		<tr><td>sProxyUsername<td>Default is an empty string.<td>Any string of characters.<td>The username BOSS uses to connect to the Internet through an authenticated proxy. If no username is given, then BOSS assumes that any proxy used is unauthenticated.
		<tr><td>sProxyPassword<td>Default is an empty string.<td>Any string of characters.<td>The password BOSS ues to connect to the Internet through an authenticated proxy. If no password is given, then BOSS assumes that any proxy used is unauthenticated.
</table>
<h4>BOSS.RunOptions</h4>
<p>These settings specify BOSS's run options. They allow you to run BOSS with non-default settings without having to use the command line or the GUI.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>sGame<td><code>auto</code><td><code>auto</code>, <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code>, <code>FalloutNV</code>, <code>Skyrim</code><td>If set to something other than <code>auto</code>, this overrides game autodetection.

<h4>BOSSLog.Filters</h4>
<p>These settings control the default states of the BOSS Log filters. If a filter's default is set to be enabled, then it will be enabled and applied when the BOSS Log is opened. These settings are all boolean switches, so <code>true</code> enables them and <code>false</code> disables them. By default all filters are disabled. See the earlier <a href="#bosslog">The BOSS Log</a> section for what each filter does.

<h4>BOSSLog.Styles</h4>
<p>These settings control the BOSS Log's CSS styles, used to provide the formatting for the BOSS Log. A knowledge of CSS is expected if you wish to alter these settings. If you do not possess such knowledge, altering these settings is not recommended.</p>

<h3 id="cli">Command Line Arguments</h3>
<p>While the BOSS GUI allows you to specify options using its graphical elements, the CLI uses a combination of the BOSS.ini file and command line arguments to do the same. The syntax for these arguments is:
<code class="box">boss [-hVuosndctUl] [-g [game]] [-r [level]] [-v [level]] [-f [type]] [-H [hostname]] [-P [port]]</code>
<code class="box">-h [ --help ]</code>
<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments, then exits.
<code class="box">-V [ --version ]</code>
<p>Prints the a banner displaying the program name and version number to the command line, then exits.
<code class="box">-u [ --update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sorts your plugins. This behaviour is enabled by default, so the command line parameter will have no effect except when the automatic masterlist updating has been disabled in the ini.
<code class="box">-U [ --no-update ]</code>
<p>Inhibits the default automatic masterlist updater, preventing it from running. Must not be used alongside --update,-u.
<code class="box">-o [ --only-update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then does <b>not</b> sort your plugins.
<code class="box">-g [ --game ] [ game ]</code>
<p>Overrides game autodetection. The valid values of the argument are: <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code>, <code>FalloutNV</code> and <code>Skyrim</code>. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS falls back to autodetection, unless <code>-o</code> is also passed, in which case BOSS will run successfully whether or not the game is installed.
<code class="box">-s [ --silent ]</code>
<p>Stops BOSS from automatically opening up the BOSS Log in your web browser (or text editor, depending on format chosen) after it has finished running.
<code class="box">-c [ --crc-display ]</code>
<p>Calculates the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, including <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Skyrim Script Extender">SKSE</abbr> plugins, and displays them in your BOSS Log alongside the plugin names.
<code class="box">-n [ --no-version-parse ]</code>
<p>Disables the parsing of each plugin's description to extract the author's version information, so it is not printed alongside the other data in the BOSS Log. This can be used if the version 
parsing is not working properly for some of your plugins and you wish to remove the version notes.
<code class="box">-f [ --format ] [ type ]</code>
<p>Allows the selection of the BOSS Log format. Valid argument values are: <code>html</code> and <code>text</code>. <code>html</code> is the default output format. The <code>text</code> value will print the BOSS Log as plain text into a 'BOSSlog.txt' file, similar to the BOSS Log in BOSS v1.5 and below.
<code class="box">-t [ --trial-run ]</code>
<p>BOSS runs, but no plugins are redated, so your load order is not changed. The BOSS Log still displays the order BOSS would have placed them in, so it is useful for checking what would happen if you ran BOSS on your load order without having to then undo BOSS's changes.
<code class="box">-r [ --revert ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Revert to a previous load order. This parameter optionally accepts values of <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>, indicating how many undo steps to apply. If no option is specified, it defaults to <code>1</code>. A value of <code>1</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
A value of <code>2</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.
<code class="box">-v [ --verbose ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Specify the verbosity level (<code>0</code> to <code>3</code>) of the debugging output. <code>0</code> is the default, showing only warning and error messages. <code>1</code> (warning, error and informational messages) is implied if this option is specified without an argument. Higher values increase the verbosity further.
<code class="box">-d [ --debug-with-source ]</code>
<p>Adds source file references (filenames and line numbers) to debugging statements.
<code class="box">-l [ log-debug ]</code>
<p>Logs the debug output to the <q>BOSSDebugLog.txt</q> file instead of the command line.
<code class="box">-H [ --proxy-host ] [ hostname ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy hostname for the masterlist updater. The hostname may be an actual hostname (eg. <code>proxy.company.com</code>), an IP address (eg. <code>192.168.32.4</code>) or <code>none</code>. <code>none</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.
<code class="box">-P [ --proxy-port ] [ port ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy port number for the masterlist updater. The port number may be any valid port number. <code>0</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.

<h3 id="special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</h3>
<p>The vast majority of users will be able to use BOSS's masterlist updater and the auto-updater with no problems. However, some users' circumstances may be such that the standard method will not work. This section provides instructions for those users.
<p>The most common special circumstance is when the computer the user has BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet. In this circumstance, the following instructions should be used to obtain masterlist updates:
<ol>
	<li>Copy <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> from your BOSS folder to the computer with an Internet connection.
	<li>Run the BOSS GUI.exe and select the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> option. 
	<li>Select the game you wish to download the masterlist for from the <q>Active Game</q> menu.
	<li>If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, also record your proxy settings in the relevant part of the GUI's <q>Settings</q> window.
	<li>Select <q>Run BOSS</q>. The masterlist will be downloaded into a subfolder, named after the game you selected, in the same location as your <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>. Some other BOSS files will also be created, you can safely delete these.
</ol>
<p>A rarer circumstance is when the user connects to the Internet using a proxy. This is most common in enterprise environments, and such users will generally know if they use a proxy. If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you must either record your proxy settings in the relevant part of the GUI's <q>Settings</q> window or manually enter your proxy settings into your <q>BOSS.ini</q> settings file. See the <a href="#customising">Customising How BOSS Works</a> section above for details on the expected settings.
<p>If your circumstances are such that the computer you have BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet, or if you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, it is recommended that you avoid using the auto-updater, simply because it is easier in these circumstances to download new releases through your web browser.
<p>There may also be other special cases which cause problems for BOSS's updaters that the BOSS team is unaware of. If you are having issues using the updaters, contact the BOSS team for support.

<h3 id="linux">Running BOSS Under Linux</h3>
<p>It is possible to run BOSS on Linux through the Wine compatibility layer, though no official support for doing so is given. Installation and usage is as on Windows. 
It is also possible to compile BOSS natively for Linux, although there is again no official support for doing so. Native Linux builds are case-sensitive in their recognition of plugins in the masterlist, and while plugins are generally added with the correct case, occasionally a plugin might have the incorrect case which would cause problems for a user with a native Linux build.

<h3 id="files">BOSS Changes and Files</h3>
<p>The only changes BOSS makes to your game install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, and create a few files in your BOSS folder. Your game's master file (Oblivion.esm, Nehrim.esm, Fallout3.esm, FalloutNV.esm or Skyrim.esm) is never altered, and all dates are derived from it.
<p><b>Note:</b> Skyrim v1.4.26+ uses a different load order mechanism to earlier games and versions of Skyrim. It uses the order of plugins in its <q>plugins.txt</q> file (found in the user's local application data folder) to determine load order instead of plugin timestamps. As such, when running for Skyrim v1.4.26+, BOSS will not alter any plugin timestamps but will instead alter the order of the contents of your <q>plugins.txt</q> file.
<p>BOSS stores all its files in the BOSS folder. BOSS's files are detailed in the table below (images for this readme are omitted).

<h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>Although BOSS is simple to use, it has grown to become a relatively complex application. As such, there are some circumstances under which BOSS may not be able to run correctly, due to a variety of possible reasons. In such cases, an error message detailing the problem should be provided. If the program unexpectedly crashes, or you experience 
a problem for which no error message is given, please report the crash or problem to an official BOSS thread (linked to in the <a href="#links">Quick Links</a> section below), so that we may fix it.
<p>If the information below does not help you to solve any problems you are experiencing, please seek further support in one of the official BOSS threads.
<h3 id="general-issues">General Problems</h3>
<p>There are a few general reasons why BOSS may fail to function correctly. Check if any of the symptoms listed below fit your issue.
<ul class="errorMessages">
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> No change in load order.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>'s <q>Lock Load Order</q><u title="previously Lock Times">*</u> load order locking feature is enabled, but <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> is not.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Enable <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>'s <q>BOSS Disable Lock Load Order</q><span title="previously BOSS Disable Lock Times">*</span> setting.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not change/update the BOSS Log and/or modlists correctly.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> The BOSS Log and/or modlists are read-only, or the BOSS folder is read-only.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure that the BOSS folder and any files in it are not read-only.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not recognise the plugins in my userlist correctly, and/or replaces some of the letters in their names with question marks.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Your userlist is not encoded in UTF-8.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Save your userlist in the UTF-8 encoding.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> You had plugins in your userlist with non-Latin letters in their names, and saved your userlist in a non-UTF8 encoding before saving it in UTF-8.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Rewrite the filenames in your userlist, copy/pasting them from the files themselves to ensure they are correct.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> Some plugins have the wrong or no version number given in the BOSS Log.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> This occurs because BOSS looks for the version number in the plugin's description field. If the plugin author has forgotten to update the version number there or not provided one, an incorrect or no version number will be displayed.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> No solution, other than the plugin author including a correct version number in the plugin's description field for a later release.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> You get an error message of the form <q>There is a problem sending the command to the program.</q>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> This is a Windows error unrelated to BOSS that may occur when it tries to open your BOSS Log (or another file, but most commonly reported for the BOSS Log).
		<li><b>Solution:</b> The exact cause is unknown, but make sure that you have the default program for HTML files set to your web browser, using the Control Panel settings.
	</ul>
</ul>

<h3 id="permissions">File Permissions</h3>
<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:
<ol>
	<li>Install the game outside the <q>Program Files</q> (or <q>Program Files (x86)</q> if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.
	<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.
	<li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.
	<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the <q>BOSS.exe</q> and <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q>, and select <q>Run as administrator</q>.
</ol>
<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.
	<li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.
	<li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.
	<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.
	<li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.
</ol>

<h3 id="international">International Character Support</h3>
<p>BOSS provides support for sorting plugins containing characters from any language via the Unicode character encoding, specifically UTF-8. All BOSS's files are encoded in UTF-8 by default. However, if you created your userlist.txt before BOSS automatically created one, you will probably need to convert it to the UTF-8 encoding, as it is not Notepad's default encoding. Below are some instructions for converting a file's encoding to UTF-8:
<ul>
	<li>Using Notepad:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
	<li>Using Notepad++:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad++.
			<li>Open the <q>Encoding</q> menu, then select <q>Convert to UTF-8</q>.
			<li>Save the file as normal.
		</ol>
</ul>
<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.

<h3 id="errors">Error Messages</h3>
<p>If BOSS can detect a specific reason for being unable to function correctly, it will print an error message detailing the problem. BOSS's error messages are listed below, along with details of the issues and possible solutions.
<ul class="errorMessages">
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>No game master .esm file found!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Your master .ESM file is deactivated and ghosted by <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-activate your master .ESM file.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS cannot detect any of the supported games.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Install BOSS locally for each of the supported games you have installed. I.e. have a BOSS folder sitting next to the Data folder of each game.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be read!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If <code>filename</code> is the masterlist, ensure that the masterlist updater is enabled and run BOSS again to download the masterlist to the correct location.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure <code>filename</code> exists, and that you have read permissions for the file and its parent folders.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be written to!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to <code>filename</code> if it exists.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" is not encoded in valid UTF-8!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> If <code>filename</code> is "userlist.txt", BOSS has detected that your userlist.txt is saved using the wrong encoding, and is unable to read it.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save the file given in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. If you are unsure on how to do so, follow these instructions:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
		<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.
		
		<li><b>Issue:</b> If <code>filename</code> is not "userlist.txt", BOSS is not functioning correctly.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save <code>filename</code> in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. Report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be found!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure <code>filename</code> exists. If <code>filename</code> is a BOSS Log and you are trying to open it from the GUI, make sure that you have run BOSS at least once	with it set to generate the format of BOSS Log you are trying to view.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>No game detected!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS cannot tell what game it is running for.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> This may occur if BOSS has been unable to detect a supported game but it is made to run anyway, eg. by running the GUI with <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> selected but the <q>Active Game</q> set to <q>None</q>. Make sure that you have selected a game to run for or set the active game.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>Master files loading after non-master plugins!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS is trying to set master plugins after non-master plugins in the load order. This won't break anything, because the game always loads masters before non-masters regardless of their load order, but it means that BOSS's output would be incorrect.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If you have ESMified any non-master plugins, ESPify them back again before running BOSS. If you have not ESMified any non-master plugins, or don't know what that means, report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>Cannot find online masterlist revision number!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Report this issue to the BOSS Development Team.
	</ul>

	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>The modification date of "<code>filename</code>" cannot be read! Filesystem response: "<code>further details</code>".</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure <code>filename</code> exists, and that you have read permissions for the file and its parent folders.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be renamed! Filesystem response: "<code>further details</code>".</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	<li><b>Message:</b> <i>"<code>filename</code>" cannot be deleted! Filesystem response: "<code>further details</code>".</i>

<p>While the GPL license allows anyone to make derivative works of BOSS, the BOSS Development Team encourages those thinking of doing so to first discuss their reasoning for such an endevour with the Team. It may be that what the derivative work would do differently from BOSS itself is already planned for a future version of BOSS or would be happily integrated into BOSS by the Team, thus avoiding any extra effort by others.
<p>The BOSS Team also appeals to the community to avoid the distribution and development of alternative masterlists, as this would only hamper the community effort to create one universally-optimised load order for all plugins available for download. Any issues with a masterlist are best brought to the attention of the BOSS Team so that we may remedy them ourselves.

<h2 id="history">Version History</h2>
<p>The changelogs for each release of BOSS are listed below. The masterlists are updated far too frequently for their changes to be concisely recorded here, but a full history of changes to them may be viewed by browsing the Google Code repository.
<p><b>Version 2.0.0</b> - <i>2012</i>
<ul>
	<li>Removed: BOSS Updater for manual installs. When an update is checked for and found on a manual install, BOSS will notify the user of the update and its download locations, but not download or install the update itself. Behaviour on installer installs is unchanged.
	<li>Removed: <code>iRunType</code> ini setting, as it was unnecessary.
	<li>Fixed: GUI mixing up Nehrim and Fallout: New Vegas in the Game drop-down box.
	<li>Fixed: Saving a masterlist-format file no longer omits its conditionals. This bug was never exposed.
	<li>Fixed: Conditional parsing errors not being reported correctly in the BOSS Log. This bug was never exposed.
	<li>Fixed: Invalid regular expressions in masterlist-format files causing crashes.
	<li>Fixed: Plugins with filenames containing international characters causing the GUI's User Rules Editor to fail to load.
	<li>Fixed: Masterlist-format files beginning with blank lines will no longer create an initial empty item in their data structures.
	<li>Fixed: Messages being outputted in the format set globally instead of the outputters local format. This bug was never exposed.
	<li>Fixed: Version number comparisons being sometimes evaluated wrongly for versions of the form a.b.c.d where a, b, c and d were integers. This bug was never exposed.
	<li>Changed: This utility's name has been changed from <q>Better Oblivion Sorting Software</q> to <q>BOSS</q>.
	<li>Changed: Tidied up code, making better use of class inheritance and swapping Boost filesystem paths for strings in plugin names.
	<li>Changed: Updated version of libcurl used from 7.23.1 to 7.24.0, and updated version of wxWidgets used from 2.9.2 to 2.9.3.
	<li>Changed: GUI's User Rules Editor is now resizeable and the Installed Mods and Masterlist lists are now tabbed to give more space for them.
	<li>Changed: BOSS no longer quits with an error message without sorting plugins when both Nehrim.esm and Oblivion.esm are present in the same Data folder, as this arrangement may be valid for modders porting mods, so long as Oblivion.esm remains inactive when Nehrim is run.
	<li>Changed: BOSS update release notes are now displayed before the update download confirmation.
	<li>Changed: Only a single instance of the GUI is now allowed to run at any one time.
	<li>Changed: Pretty pictures now in the main readme! Also updated content to reflect various changes and additions.
 	<li>Changed: Rewrote NSIS installer to reflect various changes and additions, and simplified the installer code greatly.
	<li>Changed: You can no longer sort non-master plugins before master plugins, or master plugins after non-master plugins, using user rules. Masters are commonly .ESM files, and non-master plugins are commonly .ESP files, but whether a plugin is a master or not is actually decided by a variable in the file, not the file extension. (An example of this in action would be <abbr title="Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV">Wrye *ash</abbr>'s <q>ESMify Self</q> function, which makes a plugin into a master without changing the file extension.)
	<li>Changed: BOSS now enforces the game's <q>masters before plugins</q> rule for load ordering when reading the current load order. It is not enforced for BOSS's sorting output, as only unrecognised masters are positioned after plugins, and these should be moved by the user anyway.
	<li>Added: Support for multiple games from a single BOSS install:
	<ul>
		<li>BOSS now has two different install types: local installs place the BOSS folder beside a game's Data folder. Non-local installs place the BOSS folder anywhere else. Local installs will always run for the local game by default. Non-local installs will look for supported games and prompt the user to choose one to run for each time BOSS is run. If only one game is found, BOSS will run for it without user prompt.
		<li>BOSS game files (masterlist, BOSS Log, etc.) are now stored in separate sub-folders within the BOSS folder for each game to avoid conflict.
		<li>The <code>--game,-g [ game ]</code> command line parameter and corresponding ini and GUI settings now behaves slightly differently: when BOSS is run with the game not set to autodetect, and it is not set to only update the masterlist, the game parameter specifies the default game to run for. If the default cannot be found, BOSS falls back to autodetection.
		<li>The <q>Game</q> drop-down list in the GUI has been moved to the <q>Settings</q> window.
		<li>An <q>Active Game</q> menu has been added to the GUI that allows you to change which game BOSS is currently active for without closing the GUI. Undetected games are greyed out, unless the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> run option is selected. If you have an undetected game active and switch from <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> to another run option, the BOSS automatically switches to the first detected game in the list.
		<li>If the GUI is launched and no game is detected, only the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> run option is enabled.
	</ul>
	<li>Added: BOSS API for use by third party utilities to access BOSS information and functionality. See <a href="BOSS%20API%20ReadMe.html">BOSS API ReadMe</a> for details.
	<li>Added: BOSS can now read the <q>plugins.txt</q> file that the supported games use to store their active plugin list in. BOSS also adapts to the value of the <code>bUseMyGamesDirectory</code> setting in <code>Oblivion.ini</code> when running for Oblivion.
	<li>Added: An <q>Active</q> label to the BOSS Log for plugins that are active when BOSS is run, and <q>Hide Inactive Mods</q> and <q>Hide 'Active' Label</q> BOSS Log filters.
	<li>Added: Support for the load order mechanism used by TES V: Skyrim version 1.4.26+. This outputs load order of active plugins to <q>plugins.txt</q>, and outputs the full load order to <q>loadorder.txt</q>, which is created in the same directory as <q>plugins.txt</q>.
</ul>
<p><b>Version 1.9.1</b> - <i>1 January 2012</i>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed: Mods in the last group of a masterlist being unrecognised when one or more user rules were enabled.
	<li>Fixed: Masterlist-format files saved by BOSS that contain messages cannot be loaded successfully by BOSS. This bug was never exposed.
	<li>Fixed: Every second link in a message displayed in the BOSS Log not being displayed as a hyperlink when using the HTML BOSS Log.
	<li>Fixed: MF1 legacy conditionals always being evaluated for Oblivion, even when BOSS was run for other games.
	<li>Fixed: Masterlist parsing errors were not correctly reported in the BOSS Log.
	<li>Fixed: BOSS Updater version checking not returning correct result with some versions.
	<li>Changed: Masterlist conditional evaluation now occurs separately from masterlist parsing.
	<li>Changed: BOSS Log's <q>Unrecognised Plugins</q> section is now only displayed if there are any unrecognised plugins present.
	<li>Changed: Some tidying up of the BOSS Log text and formatting.
	<li>Changed: Code type safety work. BOSS can now be built to 32 and 64 bit binaries, although 64 bit binaries will not be distributed.
	<li>Changed: Copyright license is now GNU General Public License v3.0 for everything but the documentation, and GNU Free Documentation License v1.3 for the documentation.
	<li>Changed: Updated version of libcurl used from 7.22.0 to 7.23.1, and updated version of Boost libraries used from 1.47.0 to 1.48.0.
	<li>Changed: Expanded/Collapsed indicators added for masterlist groups in the GUI's User Rules Editor.
	<li>Changed: GUI's User Rules Editor will now auto-scroll the rule list so that the currently selected rule is visible whenever the rule list is altered.
</ul>
<p><b>Version 1.9</b> - <i>13 November 2011</i>
<ul>
	<li>Changed: Major refactoring of BOSS code into a common library, a Command Line Interface and a Graphical User Interface.
	<li>Common Library:
	<ul>
		<li>Removed: Checking for changes to the recognised mod list since last run for the plain text BOSS Log, as this did not work correctly and is not feasible to fix.
		<li>Removed: Command line parameter <code>-T [ --proxy-type ] [ type ]</code> and BOSS.ini setting <code>sProxyType</code> Internet proxy type specification options. Proxy type is now automatically determined.
		<li>Fixed: A bug where if a plugin filename started with "SET" or "GLOBAL" (or case variations) then BOSS would incorrectly classify it as a variable or global message line and so result in syntax errors.
		<li>Fixed: User Rules which failed to add a plugin into the beginning or end of a group still incremented the number of recognised plugins as if the rule application had succeeded.
		<li>Fixed: Userlist rules which reference plugins that are not installed now have warning messages reported instead of error messages.
		<li>Fixed: Masterlist conditions now detect ghosted mods correctly.
		<li>Fixed: The online Fallout: New Vegas masterlist's revision being checked instead of the online Fallout 3 masterlist's revision when updating the Fallout 3 masterlist.
		<li>Fixed: The <q>Hide Messageless Mods</q> BOSS Log filter not acting when another filter resulted in all a mod's messages being hidden.
		<li>Fixed: The last group of mods in a masterlist being unrecognised.
		<li>Changed: More robust error handling.
		<li>Changed: User rules can now only use up to one sort line and/or one REPLACE message line per rule, and cannot sort mods/groups relative to themselves.
		<li>Changed: Updated version of libcurl used when building BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe to 7.22.0 from 7.21.7.
		<li>Changed: Content and slight formatting changes to BOSS Log:
		<ul>
			<li><q>Masterlist Update</q> section removed. Update information is now displayed in the <q>Summary</q> section. Updater errors are displayed in the <q>General Messages</q> section.
			<li>Javascript optimisations for filters.
			<li><q>Execution Complete</q> text is now centred.
			<li>All BOSS Log output now has special characters escaped so that it is valid HTML.
			<li>The date of the user's masterlist is now displayed in the <q>Summary</q>.
			<li>Ini parsing errors are now displayed in the <q>General Messages</q> section.
			<li>The filters are now laid out in a more grid-like fashion.
			<li>Added whitespace characters between plugin filenames, versions, ghosted labels and CRCs to make copy/pasted text more readable.
			<li>Coloured links in the dark colour scheme so that they are easier to read.
			<li>The number of plugins and messages hidden at any one time is displayed below the filters box in italics.
			<li>The Script Extender And Script Extender Plugins section is now always displayed, with CRCs only being calculated if the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option is set.
		</ul>
		<li>Changes to BOSS.ini variables:
		<ul>
			<li>Removed <q>GUI.Settings</q> and <q>GUI.LastOptions</q> sections.
			<li><q>DoStartupUpdateCheck</q> moved to a new <q>BOSS.GeneralSettings</q> section.
			<li>Removed <q>DisableMasterlistUpdate</q> setting.
			<li>Added variable type prefixes to variable names (s, i, b).
			<li>Boolean variables now accept <code>true</code> or <code>false</code> instead of <code>1</code> or <code>0</code>.
			<li><q>CommandLineVerbosity</q> renamed to <q>iDebugVerbosity</q>.
			<li><q>Debug</q> renamed to <q>bDebugWithSourceRefs</q>.
			<li>Added <q>bLogDebugOutput</q> setting to <q>BOSS.RunOptions</q> to control the logging of debugging output.
			<li>Added <q>bUseUserRulesEditor</q> setting to <q>BOSS.GeneralSettings</q> to control how to the GUI chooses to edit user rules.
			<li>Default values for the <q>BOSSLog.Styles</q> settings are now given, and values are no longer enclosed in {} brackets.
		</ul>
		<li>Changed: Major rewrite of most of the common code, including more object-orientation of code, removal of some unused functions, implementation of an class for formatted output using generic placeholders and much more.
		<li>Added: <q>Hide Clean Mods</q> and <q>Hide 'Do Not Clean' Messages</q> BOSS Log filters.
		<li>Added: Support for TES V: Skyrim and the Skyrim Script Extender.
		<li>Added: Support for MF2.2 syntax, including C-style comments, regular expression conditions, case-insensitive keywords and expanded conditional shorthands.
		<li>Added: Built-in debug output logging support.
		<li>Added: <code>DISABLE</code> keyword to user rules that can be placed before a rule's rule keyword to disable it, instead of commenting it out to do the same.
		<li>Added: Support for authenticated proxies, using the <code>sProxyUsername</code> and <code>sProxyPassword</code> BOSS.ini settings.
			<ul><li>Note that the support is untested. Feedback from users with authenticated proxies would be appreciated.</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Command Line Interface:
