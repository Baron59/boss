	<ul>
		<li>Correctly positions over 11,400 Oblivion mods and counting, including all the mod files found in such popular mods as FCOM, OOO, MMM, Better Cities, Open Cities, Race Balancing Project and many other large mods.</li>
		<li>For Oblivion, it can provide specific messages for when using OOO and Better Cities, and differentiates between FCOM and non-FCOM setups. It also detects common FCOM installation mistakes and warns the user about them.</li>
		<li>Correctly positions over 2,300 Fallout 3 mods and counting.
		<li>Correctly positions over 1,800 Fallout: New Vegas mods and counting.
		<li>Provides support for sorting mods used in Nehrim - At Fate's Edge installs.</li>
		<li>Provides useful load order notes for many mods.</li>
		<li>Displays the version number of mods when it is available.</li>
		<li>Allows easy user customisation of mod positions and the messages provided.</li>
		<li>Provides Bash Tag suggestions that are automatically applied by Wrye Bash (for Oblivion), Wrye Flash (for Fallout 3) or Wrye Flash NV (for Fallout: New Vegas).</li>
		<li>Sorts mod files ghosted by Wrye Bash/Flash.</li>
		<li>Is under constant development and improvement by a team of modders and experts on all supported games.</li>	
	</ul>
	<p>Better Oblivion Sorting Software (BOSS) will reorder your mods to their correct positions (as listed in the masterlist.txt database file), putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.</p>
	<p>BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods such as FCOM, MMM and FOOK, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there 
	(estimated at about 30,000 for Oblivion, and about 11,000 for Fallout 3) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for the relevant game is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.</p>
	</div>
	<br /><br />
	
	<div id="install"><span>Installation &amp; Basic Usage</span>
	<p>BOSS can be installed for use with Oblivion, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas or Nehrim - At Fate's Edge (a Total Conversion mod for Oblivion). Installation may either be automated, using the BOSS Installer package, or manually, using the archive package. Either method is simple, and instructions for manual installation are given below.</p>
	<ol>
		<li>If you have Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV, make sure the "Lock Times" function is deactivated.</li>
		<li>If upgrading from an earlier version of BOSS, delete all BOSS files and folders in your game's Data folder (including the BOSS folder, BOSS.exe, masterlist.txt, modlist.txt, modlist.old, BOSSlog.txt and any of BOSS's .bat files).  If you have an edited masterlist, make sure to keep a backup so that your edits are not lost.</li>
		<li>Extract the BOSS archive you downloaded to your game's installation directory (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of "Oblivion", "Fallout 3", "Nehrim" or "fallout new vegas" depending on your game), so that there is now a BOSS folder alongside the Data folder and the game's executable.</li>
		<li>In the BOSS folder, run the "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" file to get the latest masterlist from the Internet and sort your mods.</li>
		<li>When running BOSS normally, do so from the BOSS.exe, but remember to run the "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" regularly to ensure you have a recent masterlist.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If you have more than one of the supported games installed, you should install BOSS separately for each one.</p>
	<p>Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. Wrye Bash/Flash will automatically import and apply Bash Tag 
	suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in Wrye Bash/Flash if necessary.</p>
	<p>You will need to reorder "unknown" mods by hand using OBMM/FOMM or Wrye Bash/Flash.</p>
	<p>You can update your masterlist to the latest version by running the "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" file. This will replace your copy with the latest available online, and then run BOSS as normal using the updated masterlist. <b>If you 
	have an edited masterlist, using this updater will cause you to lose all your edits.</b></p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="remove"><span>Uninstallation</span>
	<p>Delete the BOSS folder in your game's installation folder (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of "Oblivion", "Fallout 3", "Nehrim" or "fallout new vegas" depending on your game).</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="details"><span>Further Details</span><br />
	<br /><span class="subtitle">Command Line Arguments</span>
	<p>BOSS has a number of command-line arguments. The syntax is:</p>
	<div>
	<p><code>boss [-hVuosndc] [-g [game]] [-r [level]] [-v [level]] [-f [type]]</code></p>
	<p><code>-h [ --help ]</code></p>
	<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments, then exits.</p>
	<p><code>-V [ --version ]</code></p>
	<p>Prints the a banner displaying the program name and version number to the command line, then exits.</p>
	<p><code>-u [ --update ]</code></p>
	<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sorts your mods. Since this replaces your current 
	masterlist, don't run this if you have an edited copy and wish to keep the changes. The "BOSS - Update Masterlist.bat" runs BOSS with this switch.</p>
	<p><code>-o [ --only-update ]</code></p>
	<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then does NOT sort your mods. Since this replaces your current 
	masterlist, don't run this if you have an edited copy and wish to keep the changes.</p>
	<p><code>-g [ --game ] [ game ]</code></p>
	<p>Overrides game autodetection. The valid values of the argument are: 'Oblivion', 'Nehrim', 'Fallout3', and 'Fallout3NV'. This only allows the masterlist to be updated, so should be used in conjunction with -o or BOSS will still fail before any mods are sorted
	if the game you specify is not the game BOSS is installed for, or no game is present.</p>
	<p><code>-s [ --silent ]</code></p>
	<p>Stops BOSS from automatically opening up the BOSSlog in your web browser after it has finished running.</p>
	<p><code>-n [ --no-version-parse ]</code></p>
	<p>Disables the parsing of each mod's description to extract the author's version information, so it is not printed alongside other data in the generated BOSSlog.html. This can be used if the version 
	parsing is not working properly for some of your mods, and you wish to remove the version notes.</p>
	<p><code>-r [ --revert ] [ level ]</code></p>
	<p>Revert to a previous load order. This parameter optionally accepts values of 1 or 2, indicating how many undo steps to apply. If no option is specified, it defaults to 1. A value of 1 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
	A value of 2 will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.</p>
	<p><code>-v [ --verbose ] [ level ]</code></p>
	<p>Specify verbosity level (0-3). 0 is the default, showing only warning and error messages. 1 (warning, error and informational messages) is implied if this option is specified without an argument. Higher values increase the verbosity further.</p>
	<p><code>-d [ --debug ]</code></p>
	<p>Adds source file references (filenames and line numbers) to logging statements.</p>
	<p><code>-c [ --crc-display ]</code></p>
	<p>Calculates the CRCs of all the plugins in your Data folder and displays them in your BOSSlog alongside the plugin names. The CRCs can be used in masterlist conditionals, as a highly precise method of version checking.</p>
	<p><code>-f [ --format ] [ type ]</code></p>
	<p>Allows the selection of the BOSSlog format. Valid argument values are: 'html' and 'text'. 'html' is the default output format used when this argument is not present.</p>
	
	</div><br />
	<br /><span class="subtitle">BOSS Changes and Files</span>
	<p>The only changes BOSS makes to your game install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, and create a few text files in your BOSS folder. Your game's master file (Oblivion.esm, Fallout3.esm, Nehrim.esm or FalloutNV.esm) 
	is never touched, and all dates are derived from it.</p>
	<div>BOSS's files are all found in the BOSS folder, and they are:
	<ul>
		<li><i>masterlist.txt</i> - This is the master list of mods that BOSS recognises, listing them in order and which includes notes attached to them. It is the most frequently updated component of BOSS, receiving updates almost every day.</li>
		<li><i>BOSSlog.html</i> - This log is where the output that BOSS generates and displays once the program ends is stored. It is replaced every time you run BOSS. You can view it in any web browser.</li>
		<li><i>modlist.txt</i> - This file contains the list of your mods in the order they were before you last ran BOSS, which can be used to undo changes to your load order.</li>
		<li><i>modlist.old</i> - This file contains the contents of your modlist.txt before you last ran BOSS, providing a second level of undo for load order changes.</li>
		<li><i>userlist.txt</i> - This file contains your custom rules to be implemented by the User Rules feature.</li>
	</ul>
	</div><br />
	<br /><span class="subtitle">Undoing Changes</span>
	<div><p>To undo the changes BOSS makes to your load order, you can use the included "BOSS - Undo Last Run.bat" file.
	The .bat file will, by default, revert to the load order before the last run of BOSS, as stored in modlist.txt. If you want to revert back to the load order before that, as stored in modlist.old, you will need to edit your "BOSS - Undo Last Run.bat"
	file:
	<ol>
		<li>Right-click it and select "Edit" to open it up in Notepad.</li>
		<li>On the line containing "<code>BOSS.exe -r 1</code>", replace the 1 with a 2 to give "<code>BOSS.exe -r 2</code>".</li>
		<li>Then save the file and run it to revert your load order back two levels.</li>
	</p></div><br />
	<br /><span class="subtitle">Customising How BOSS Works</span>
	<p>Users can customise how BOSS works through the included User Rules feature. This feature allows you to define the positions of mods not in the masterlist, and to override the masterlist positions of mods,
	as well as edit the output messages of mods, and more. In addition, this is all done without editing the masterlist.txt, so when you update it using the built-in updater, your changes shall not be lost. All the information on the User Rules feature can be found in the "BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html" file.</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="help"><span>Contributions &amp; Help</span>
	<p>General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised mods, takes place in BOSS's official threads for <a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1167297">Oblivion</a>, <a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1132338">Nehrim</a>, <a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1098111">Fallout 3</a> and <a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1173252">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p>
	<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.</p>
	<p>Lists of unrecognised mods are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).</li>
		<li>A link to where the description, mod or readme can be found to read or download.</li>
		<li>A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.</li>
	</ul>

	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="troubleshooting"><span>Troubleshooting</span>
	<p>Under some circumstances, BOSS may not be able to run properly due to a variety of reasons. In such cases, BOSS should be able to provide an error message detailing the type of fault. If the program unexpectedly crashes, the crash and the circumstances in which it occurred should be reported to the official BOSS thread (linked to in the <em>Quick Links</em> section below), so that we may fix it.
	Here is a list of the error messages and their common causes:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Message:</b> ERROR: file '<em>filename</em>' could not be accessed for writing.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the given file if it exists.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />	
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: Master .ESM file not found!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS is not being run in the correct folder.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Move the BOSS folder containing all of BOSS's files into your game's installation folder, which is the one that contains the Data folder.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Your master .ESM file is deactivated and ghosted by Wrye Bash/Flash.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-activate your master .ESM file.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Error: Masterlist update failed.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Masterlist cannot be opened.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that your BOSS folder (and masterlist.txt if it exists) is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Curl error.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> There was a problem in getting information from the Internet. Depending on the error given, make sure your Internet connection is working correctly, or try again later. If you use a proxy make sure that the proxy service is running.</li>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Cannot find online masterlist revision number.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> The layout of the Google Code page has changed, and a program update will be required to take account of this. Please report this issue in the official forum thread.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: <em>filename</em> cannot be read!<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> <em>filename</em> does not exist, is in the wrong place, or is corrupt in some way.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> If <em>filename</em> is your game's master .ESM file and this error is displayed, it means that your master .ESM file exists, but its date cannot be read. This can only take place under very specialised circumstances, such as corruption of your master .ESM file, and probably means you will have to seek expert help.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> If <em>filename</em> is 'masterlist.txt' and this error is displayed, make sure that your masterlist.txt is in your BOSS folder, or use the masterlist updater to download a new masterlist to the correct place.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Error: Could not change the date of "<em>filename</em>", make sure you have write access to it.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the plugin given.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Check that the plugin is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See later on in this section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Message:</b> Critical Error: "<em>filename</em>" is not encoded in valid UTF-8. Please save the file using the UTF-8 encoding.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS has detected that your userlist.txt is saved using the wrong encoding, and is unable to read it.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save your userlist.txt in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. If you are unsure on how to do so, please see the instructions below on how to do so.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<p>In addition to the specific error messages above, BOSS may also fail to work properly, or appear to do so, for a few general reasons:</p>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> No change in load order.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> Wrye Bash's "Lock Times" load order locking feature is enabled.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Disable "Lock Times" before running BOSS.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
		<br />
		<li><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not change/update the BOSSlog and/or modlists correctly.<div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
		<ul>
			<li><b>Issue:</b> The BOSSlog and/or modlists are read-only, or the BOSS folder is read-only.</li>
			<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure that the BOSS folder and any files in it are not read-only.</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	<br />
	<p>BOSS provides support for sorting mods containing characters from any language via the Unicode character encoding, specifically UTF-8. Your userlist must therefore be encoded in UTF-8 to ensure that BOSS reads it correctly. To save your userlist in the UTF-8 encoding, follow these instructions:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Open your userlist.txt in Notepad.</li>
		<li>Open the "File" menu, then select "Save As...".</li>
		<li>In the Save As dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled "Encoding:". Select "UTF-8" from this list.</li>
		<li>Click the "Save" button, answering "Yes" to any confirmation prompts.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>The modlists and masterlist must also be encoded in UTF-8, but they should automatically be encoded correctly when BOSS creates them.</p>
    <p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Install the game outside the "Program Files" (or "Program Files (x86)" if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.</li>
		<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.</li>
		<li>Give yourself Full Control permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.</li>
		<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the BOSS.exe, and select "Run as administrator".</li>
	</ol>
	<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves Full Control permissions, here is a guide:</p>
	<ol>
		<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select "Properties".</li>
		<li>In Properties, select the "Security" tab, and click the "Edit..." button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.</li>
		<li>In the "Group or user names" box, select the "Users" option.</li>
		<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite "Full Control" in the "Allow" column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.</li>
		<li>In the Properties window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.</li>
	</ol>
	<p>If the above information does not help you to solve any problems you are experiencing, please seek further support in one of the official BOSS threads.</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="linux"><span>Running BOSS Under Linux</span>
	<p>It is possible to run BOSS on Linux through the Wine compatibility layer, though no official support for doing so is given. Installation and usage is as on Windows. While all the features work as they do in Windows, there are a few issues:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>BOSS runs noticeably slower on Linux through Wine than it does natively on Windows.</li>
		<li>The BOSSlog is not automatically displayed once BOSS has run. In this case, you will have to open <code>BOSS/BOSSlog.html</code> manually to see it.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>It is also possible to compile BOSS from the source code as a native application on Linux. Again, no support is given for doing so. The BOSS Team does not supply pre-compiled Linux binaries or instructions for building BOSS in Linux at this time, although a makefile is included in the source code to ease the process.</p>
	</div><br /><br />
	
	<div id="credits"><span>Credits</span>
	<p>As BOSS is very much a community project, credit is due to a very large number of sources and people outside of the BOSS Team. Credit goes to the following:
	<p>For load order information:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Agiel's Annotated Load Order.</li>
		<li>Fivefries load order.</li>
		<li>dev_akm's expanded FCOM load order.</li>
		<li>The Martigen's Monster Mod Team.</li>
		<li>The Better Cities developers.</li>
		<li>Many, many modders and users who have posted suggestions and instructions in the BOSS threads and on the Nexus sites.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Some people have gone out of their way and provided continuing, expert and detailed help - thank you very much! In addition to the above, the following people are credited with additional non-load-order-related support:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Wrye and the rest of the Wrye Bash Team: For implementing the importing of BOSS's Bashed Patch tag suggestions and general support for BOSS into <a href="http://wrye.ufrealms.net/Wrye%20Bash.html">Wrye Bash</a>.</li>
		<li>The Beta Testing &amp; Analysis Guild at TESAlliance: For extensive testing and giving feedback on v1.6 prior to release.</li>
		<li>Surazal: For extensive testing and feedback during developement of v1.6, and for providing the inspiration for many features through his BOSS Masterlist Manager macro for Microsoft Word.</li>
		<li>myk002: For extensive code contributions and testing during development of v1.6+.</li>
		<li>Hickory: For providing the icon used by the BOSS executable in v1.7.</li>

	<div id="history"><span>Version History</span>
	<p>Only updates to the BOSS program are recorded here, not masterlist updates, as that is updated far too frequently to be concisely recorded. A full record of changes made to the masterlist may be viewed by browsing the Google Code repository.</p>

	<ul>

		<li>Added two new command line parameters:
		<ul><div style="height:0.65em;"></div>
			<li>-g, --game [ game ]: Overrides game autodetection. To be used in conjunction with -o to allow updating of the masterlist on computers where the specified game is not installed.</li>
			<li>-c, --crc-display: Enables calculation of plugin CRCs and displays them in the BOSSlog. CRCs can be used as accurate version checks in masterlist conditionals.</li>
