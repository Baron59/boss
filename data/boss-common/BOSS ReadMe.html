	<li>Is under constant development and improvement by a team of modders and experts on all supported games.
</ul>
<p>Better Oblivion Sorting Software (BOSS) will re-order your mod plugins to their correct positions, putting any mods it doesn't recognise after them, in the same order as they were before BOSS was run.
<p>BOSS is designed to assist in the installation and usage of mods, especially more complex mods such as FCOM, MMM, FOOK and nVamp, and help mod users avoid serious conflicts. It is not a complete solution to load ordering issues, as there are far more mods out there 
(estimated at about 25,000 for Oblivion, 12,000 for Fallout 3 and 6,000 for Fallout: New Vegas) than BOSS knows about. To properly place mods BOSS doesn't know about, a good working knowledge of mod load ordering for the relevant game is still necessary, for which some research and documentation reading will go a long way.
</div>

<div id="install"><h1>Installation &amp; Basic Usage</h1>
<p><b>Note that BOSS does not support Windows 2000 or earlier.</b>
<p>BOSS can be installed for use with TES IV: Oblivion, TES V: Skyrim, Fallout 3, Fallout: New Vegas or Nehrim - At Fate's Edge (a Total Conversion mod for Oblivion). Installation may either be automated, using the BOSS Installer package, or manually, using the archive package. Either method is simple, and instructions for manual installation are given below.
<ol>
	<li>If you have Wrye Bash, Wrye Flash or Wrye Flash NV, make sure the <q>Lock Times</q> function is deactivated.
	<li>If upgrading from an earlier version of BOSS, delete all BOSS files and folders in your game's Data folder (including the BOSS folder, BOSS.exe, masterlist.txt, modlist.txt, modlist.old, BOSSlog.txt and any of BOSS's .bat files).  If you have an edited masterlist, make sure to keep a backup so that your edits are not lost. It is recommended that you instead use the user rules functionality to apply changes to the masterlist.
	<li>Extract the BOSS archive you downloaded to your game's installation directory (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q>, <q>fallout new vegas</q> or <q>skyrim</q> depending on your game), so that there is now a BOSS folder alongside the Data folder and the game's executable.
	<li>In the BOSS folder, run the <q>BOSS.exe</q>. This will download the latest masterlist from the Internet and then sort your mods.
</ol>
<p>If you are installing BOSS manually and have more than one of the supported games installed, you should install BOSS separately for each one.
<p>Once BOSS has finished running, the output will be displayed automatically. Read any notes, errors if applicable, and make any relevant changes that are suggested by them. Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV will automatically import and apply Bash Tag 
suggestions from BOSS. Some Bash Tag suggestions can come with conditions and notes that require human intervention though, so read the suggestions makes thoroughly and adjust tags by hand in Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV if necessary.
<p>You will need to reorder unrecognised mods by hand using <abbr title="Oblivion Mod Manager">OBMM</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Mod Manager">FOMM</abbr> or Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV.
</div>

<div id="remove"><h1>Uninstallation</h1>
<p>If you installed BOSS using the installer, then use the uninstaller it provides a link to in your Start Menu to uninstall BOSS. If you installed BOSS manually, do the following:
<ol><li>Delete the BOSS folder in your game's installation folder (ie. the one containing the Data folder and the game's executable, so one of <q>Oblivion</q>, <q>Fallout 3</q>, <q>Nehrim</q>, <q>fallout new vegas</q> or <q>skyrim</q> depending on your game).</ol>
</div>

<div id="general"><h1>General Usage</h1>
<p>This section gives more information on the parts of BOSS's functionality that users are likely to come into contact with during the course of general usage of BOSS. It gives details on the capabilities of the GUI, information on how to keep BOSS up to date, information on the BOSS Log and its constituent parts, and provides some background information and BOSS-specific notes on the subject of dirty edits and mod cleaning.
<h2 id="gui">The Graphical User Interface</h2>
<p>BOSS comes with a <abbr title="Graphical User Interface">GUI</abbr> that provides easy access to all of BOSS's functions and features. It allows you to:
<ul>
	<li>Change BOSS's output options:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Show BOSS Log On Completion</i>: Open the BOSS Log automatically after BOSS is finished.
		<li><i>Enable Debug Output</i>: Add source code references to the command line output.
		<li><i>Log Command Line Output</i>: Save the command line output to a <q>BOSSCommandLineLog.txt</q> text file.
		<li><i>BOSS Log Format</i>: Specify the format of the BOSS Log generated, and the format that the GUI attempts to open when you click the <q>View BOSS Log</q> button.
		<li><i>Command Line Verbosity</i>: The verbosity of the command line logging output. As values increase, so does verbosity, 'Standard (0)' displays only warning and error messages.
	</ul>
	<li>Easily select from the three main modes of operation BOSS can run in, and specify their run options:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Sort Mods</i>: The standard mode of operation, sorting your mods. Its options are:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Update Masterlist</i>: Run the masterlist updater during BOSS's operation.
			<li><i>Display Mod Versions</i>: Display in the BOSS Log the version information extracted from plugin descriptions.
			<li><i>Display File CRCs</i>: Calculate and display in the BOSS Log the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, and of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins.
			<li><i>Perform Trial Run</i>: When BOSS is run, simulate its changes to your load order without actually reordering your mods.
		</ul>
		<li><i>Update Masterlist Only</i>: Updates your masterlist then immediately quits. Its option is:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Game</i>: The game is BOSS installed for. This affects which masterlist BOSS downloads and which master file to look for. 'Autodetect' tells BOSS to decide for itself based on what master file is present.
		</ul>
		<li><i>Undo Changes</i>: Sorts your mods into the order they were in before you last ran BOSS, or the order they were in before the second-last time you ran BOSS, depending on the revert level chosen. Its options are:
		<ul>
			<li><i>Undo Level</i>: Specify how many runs of BOSS to undo.
			<li><i>Display Mod Versions</i>: Display in the BOSS Log the version information extracted from plugin descriptions.
			<li><i>Display File CRCs</i>: Calculate and display in the BOSS Log the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder, and of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins.
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<li>Change BOSS and GUI settings:
	<ul>
		<li><i>Check for BOSS updates on GUI startup</i>: Controls whether or not the GUI checks for updates automatically when it starts up.
		<li><i>Proxy Type</i>: Specify the type of proxy you use to connect to the Internet, if you use one.
		<li><i>Proxy Hostname</i>: Specify the hostname of your proxy, if you use one.
		<li><i>Proxy Port Number</i>: Specify the port number through which your proxy is accessed, if you use one.
	</ul>
	<li>Launch BOSS.
	<li>Open your userlist for editing.
	<li>Open your BOSS Log for viewing.
	<li>Open BOSS's ReadMes.
	<li>Launch the <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality, which includes an automatic updater that can get new releases of BOSS for you. The <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality also runs when the GUI launches, but only displays a message if an update was found or there was an error encountered while checking.
</ul>
<p>Each setting in the GUI corresponds to a command line parameter and/or an ini setting, the details of which can be found in the <q><a href="#details">Further Details</a></q> and <q><a href="#customising">Customising How BOSS Works</a></q> sections of this ReadMe respectively.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="updates">Keeping BOSS Up-To-Date</h2>
<p>It is important that you keep your BOSS installation updated, not only to benefit from the many frequent updates made to the masterlists, but also to benefit from bug fixes, improvements and new features introduced to new releases of BOSS itself.
<p>Providing there is an Internet connection available when BOSS runs, it will automatically download and apply any updates available for the masterlists. BOSS will also check for new releases and if an update is available, it will ask the user if they want to download and install it. The check for new releases functionality behaves as outlined below:
<ol>
 <li>On launching, it automatically checks for updates to BOSS. If an update is found, it proceeds to the next step. If no update is available, or no Internet connection is present, it will display no message.
 <ul>
  <li>If you run the <q>Check For Updates</q> option from the GUI's Help option, then it will display messages detailing if no update was found or if there were any errors.
 </ul>
 <li>No matter how the update check was started, if an update is available it will prompt the user whether or not to download and install the update. If the user decides not to update, the updater will quit.
 <li>If the user decides to update, then it will begin downloading the file(s) to the BOSS folder, displaying a progress bar. The download can be cancelled at any time, in which case any downloaded files will be deleted and the updater will quit.
 <ul>
  <li>If you previously installed BOSS using the installer, then the updater shall download the installer for the update, otherwise it will download the files as they appear in the manual archive.
 </ul>
 <li>Once the download is complete, the updater will install the downloaded file(s).
 <ul>
  <li>If the installer was downloaded, it will be launched, and the updater and GUI shall exit. Complete the installation wizard to finish updating.
  <li>If the manual archive files were downloaded, the old BOSS files (BOSS.exe, the ReadMes) will be deleted and replaced with the new ones. The updater will then tell you to rename the downloaded BOSS GUI file to the correct filename, then exit. You must manually rename the file, deleting the old GUI executable, to complete the update.
</ol>
<p>Under certain circumstances the masterlist and program updaters may be unable to function fully. If you have issues using them, see the <q><a href="#special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</a></q> section for alternative methods.

<p>BOSS program updates are also published at the
<a href="http://www.tesnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=20516">TES Nexus</a>, 
<a href="http://www.fallout3nexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=10193">Fallout 3 Nexus</a> and 
<a href="http://www.newvegasnexus.com/downloads/file.php?id=35999">New Vegas Nexus</a> BOSS pages. For those not using the masterlist updater, the latest masterlist is always on the <a href="http://code.google.com/p/better-oblivion-sorting-software/">Google Code repository</a>.
<p>Always make sure to use the latest version of BOSS and the latest masterlist.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="bosslog">The BOSS Log</h2>
<p>The BOSS Log is where you will find all of BOSS's outputted information. It can be generated in either HTML format (the default) or as a plain text file with minimal formatting. The HTML format has significant advantages over the plain text format, being considerably easier to read, containing colour-coded messages and a variety of filters to customise what is displayed. However, other than the HTML BOSS Log providing a notification if there has been no change in the recognised mod list since last run, there is no difference in information between the two formats.
<p>The HTML BOSS Log has been tested in Mozilla Firefox 4, Google Chrome 11, Opera 11 and Internet Explorer 9. Using earlier browsers may result in parts of the BOSS Log not working or displaying correctly.
<p>The BOSS Log comprises of a number of sections, which are detailed in the table below.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>BOSS Log Section<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>General Messages<td>This section is only displayed if there are any applicable messages to be displayed. Its primary purpose is to allow BOSS to display messages specific to your Oblivion install that are not specific to any one mod. Parser and updater error messages are also displayed in this section.
		<tr><td>Summary<td>This section gives a short summary of BOSS's actions. It breaks down the numbers of plugins installed and messages attached to them and gives the local masterlist version and whether or not it was updated. If the BOSS Log is in the HTML format it will also display a message if your recognised plugin list has not changed since you last ran BOSS.
		<tr><td>Userlist Messages<td>This section is only displayed if BOSS finds any user rules in your userlist. It details the successes or failures of the application of your userlist rules.
		<tr><td>Script Extender And Script Extender Plugin Checksums<td>This section is displayed when BOSS is run with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled and you have your game's Script Extender installed. It will list the Script Extender and any plugins for it that you have installed, displaying their versions (if given) and their CRCs.
		<tr><td>Recognised And Re-ordered Plugins<td>This section comprises the bulk of BOSS's output, listing all your recognised installed plugins and any messages BOSS has attached to them, as well as version information (if given) and the plugin CRCs (if run with <q>Display File CRCs</q> enabled). 
		<tr><td>Restored Load Order<td>This section is only displayed when BOSS is run to undo its changes, and lists your restored load order.
		<tr><td>Unrecognised Plugins<td>This section lists any plugins you have installed that have not been recognised by BOSS. These plugins should be reported in an official BOSS thread with download links to their mods so they can be added to the relevant masterlist.
</table>
<p>BOSS will display the version numbers of any plugins that provide version information in their description fields. If a plugin does not supply any version information, no version number will be displayed for it. The version number of plugins may occasionally not match the version of the mod installed - this is due to the mod author forgetting to update the plugin's version information. When in doubt, check the version number given in a mod's readme.
<p>It should be noted that the vast majority of BOSS's mod messages are non-conditional, in that they are not displayed in response to your specific install. For example, a message that gives some of the mod's incompatibilities does not know if you have them installed or not, and a message telling you to do something will not know if it has been done.
<p>BOSS's mod messages are one of the most important features BOSS provides, acting as a means of providing users with information that they might otherwise not obtain. It is important for a stable, healthy game that you act on any messages that require action. If you think a message suggests an action that is not necessary, report it to an official BOSS thread.
<p>The HTML BOSS Log includes a few features and a number of filters to customise what is displayed. The majority of these are found in the shaded box near the top of the BOSS Log, and are enabled and disabled via their checkboxes:
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>BOSS Log Filter<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>Use Dark Colour Scheme<td>Changes the BOSS Log's colour scheme to a darker variety, more suitable for reading in low light levels and putting less strain on the eyes. Users with vision impairments may find the darker colour scheme easier to read.
		<tr><td>Hide Rule Warnings<td>Hides any warning messages printed in the <q>Userlist Messages</q> section of the BOSS Log.
		<tr><td>Hide Version Numbers<td>Hides the version numbers printed in blue next to those mods that provide them.
		<tr><td>Hide 'Ghosted' Label<td>Hides the 'Ghosted' label printed in grey next to any mods ghosted by Wrye Bash.
		<tr><td>Hide Checksums<td>Hides the checksums of mods and Script Extender plugins printed in brown next to their names.
		<tr><td>Hide Messageless Mods<td>Hides any recognised mods that do not have messages attached to them.
		<tr><td>Hide Ghosted Mods<td>Hides any mods that have been ghosted by Wrye Bash.
		<tr><td>Hide Clean Mods<td>Hides any mods in your load order that don't have messages beginning <q>Contains dirty edits: </q> attached. Note that this doesn't mean the mods hidden are definitely clean, only that BOSS doesn't know they're dirty.
		<tr><td>Hide All Mod Nessages<td>Hides all messages attached to mods.
		<tr><td>Hide Notes<td>Hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Note: </q> prefix.
		<tr><td>Hide Bash Tag Suggestions<td>Hides any Bash Tag suggestions attached to mods.
		<tr><td>Hide Requirements<td>Hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Requires: </q> prefix.
		<tr><td>Hide Incompatibilities<td>Hides any messages attached to mods that have the <q>Incompatible with: </q> prefix.
</table>
<p>In addition to the above filters, clicking on a section's title will collapse that section, hiding its contents. Clicking the title again will expand the section, making its contents visible again.
<p>It is not possible to hide mod warning or error messages, as these are of a severity where they should almost certainly be acted upon, and not ignored. Be aware that if you hide all a mod's messages and then hide all messageless mods, that mod will be amongst those hidden.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="dirtymods">Dirty Edits, Mod Cleaning &amp; CRCs</h2>
<p>
<p>Dirty edits are often a side-effect of mod creation, and are often due to bugs in the utilities Bethesda has provided to create mods, rather than bad practice by mod authors. Dirty edits can cause a wide range of issues, including incorrect game settings, missing content, broken quests and crashing to desktop. The more dirty edits there are, and the more mods with dirty edits you use, the more likely you are to experience issues.
<p>Thankfully there is a way to remove dirty edits from mods relatively easily, a process known as <i>mod cleaning</i>, using TES4Edit (for Oblivion), FO3Edit (for Fallout 3) or FNVEdit (for Fallout: New Vegas). A detailed set of instructions and information on mod cleaning can be found on the CS Wiki's <a href="http://cs.elderscrolls.com/constwiki/index.php/TES4Edit_Cleaning_Guide">TES4Edit Cleaning Guide</a> (the page also applies to Fallout 3 and Fallout: New Vegas). Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV can also scan plugins for dirty edits and return their ITM and UDR counts, though at the time of writing it cannot clean plugins itself.
<p>The problem of dirty edits is largely a problem of ignorance on the part of mod authors and users alike of the problems unclean mods (more widely known as <i>dirty mods</i>) can cause. As such, there are community efforts to raise awareness of dirty edits and cleaning. BOSS plays a key role in these efforts, as it holds the complete list of all known dirty mods, and it uses this information to provide notification messages to users for any dirty mods they have installed.
There are three key pieces of information that are used to accurately describe and identify an unclean mod. They are:
<ul>
	<li><i>ITM Count</i>: ITM (Identical To Master) records are a type of dirty edit where a mod has overwritten something in the game without actually changing anything. If another mod lower in the load order makes an intentional change to that thing, it will have its effect cancelled out by the ITM record, which can cause problems. The ITM count is the number of ITM records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i>UDR Count</i>: Deleting records is a significant cause of crashes and game bugs. UDR (Undeleted and Disabled Reference) records are records that the mod deleted from the game or from another mod that have been corrected safely by undeleting them and disabling them instead, which has the same intended effect without causing issues. The UDR count is the number of deleted reference records found and corrected in the mod plugin.
	<li><i>CRC</i> or <i>Checksum</i>: A file's CRC is a highly accurate way of identifying it, and is a number calculated from the file's contents. If the contents of a file changes, so will its CRC. BOSS uses CRCs to check if a user's mods are dirty by checking their CRCs against pre-determined CRCs of known dirty mods. This lets BOSS give precise notification messages for any dirty mods it detects. BOSS can calculate the CRCs of all your installed plugins if run from the GUI with the <q>Display File CRCs</q> option enabled.
</ul>
<p>However, not all unclean mods have all or any of these pieces of information. For unclean mods whose ITM and UDR counts have not been reported, BOSS cannot give them. For unclean mods whose CRCs have not been reported, BOSS cannot give precise notification and so prints a message whether or not the user has cleaned their mod.
<p>BOSS and the modding communities rely on user contribution of this information to progress. For information on how to contribute, see the <q><a href="#help">Contributions &amp; Help</a></q> section below. If you find that a mod is dirty, you should also report this to the mod's author so that they can fix it.
<p>It should be noted that TES4Edit will include a variety of <em>junk records</em> in the ITM count for a plugin, such as new empty cells that are automatically generated by the Construction Set and are almost impossible to remove. These junk records are non-harmful, and BOSS will inform users when a mod contains these to avoid confusion.
<p>There is also another type of unnecessary edit, known as a wild edit, that can also cause problems. These edits are neither Itentical To Master edits nor deleted records, so cannot be automatically cleaned. Cleaning must be manually done in TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit. BOSS can still check for plugins with these edits if the CRCs of the plugins with wild edits are known, and it can provide notification of these edits and some information on fixing them if they are reported in an official BOSS thread.
</div>

<div id="help"><h1>Contributions &amp; Help</h1>
<p>General discussion, and the submission of questions, suggestions and unrecognised or unclean plugins, takes place in BOSS's official threads for 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1195328">Oblivion</a>, 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1132338">Nehrim</a>, 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1175276">Fallout 3</a> and 
<a href="http://forums.bethsoft.com/?showtopic=1203068">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.
<p>User contribution of additions and corrections to the masterlist are vital to the upkeep of BOSS. Let us know what you know.
<p>Lists of unrecognised plugins are welcome but the only way we can include them in the database in a timely way is if we get:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>A link to where the description, mod or readme can be found to read or download.
	<li>A brief description of each mod will also help. Feel free to make load order suggestions.
</ul>
<p>Lists of unclean plugins are also very welcome, but for the report to be most useful we require:
<ul>
	<li>The ESP/ESM file name(s).
	<li>The number of records removed (the ITM count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The number of records undeleted (the UDR count) as shown by TES4Edit/FO3Edit/FNVEdit or Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV (not the number of records processed).
	<li>The CRC(s) of the unlcean ESP/ESM file name(s). Make sure that the CRCs are of the uncleaned files, not the files after cleaning. The CRC(s) may be calculated using BOSS, Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV or 7-zip, with other sources being unverified as correct. In the case of 7-zip, the <q>CRC checksum for data</q> is the one required.
</ul>
</div>

<div id="advanced"><h1>Advanced Usage</h1>
<p>This section gives information on how to operate BOSS under certain conditions, how to customise its behaviour more fully than previously covered, and provides details for all the BOSS files.

<h2 id="customising">Customising How BOSS Works</h2>
<p>Users can customise how BOSS handles their plugins through the included User Rules feature. This feature allows you to define the positions of plugins not in the masterlist, and to override the masterlist positions of plugins,
as well as edit the output messages of plugins, and more. In addition, this is all done without editing the masterlist.txt, so when you update it using the built-in updater, your changes are not lost. All the information on the User Rules feature can be found in the "BOSS User Rules ReadMe.html" file.
<p>For users who wish to be provided with a GUI feature for managing their userlist and own a copy of Microsoft Word 2003, 2007 or 2010, Surazal's <a href="">BOSS Userlist Manager</a> is a comprehensive utility that provides a range of features that may prove useful.
<p>Users can also edit a number of BOSS's default settings in the BOSS.ini. As this is where BOSS gets its settings from, care must be taken to edit it correctly to prevent breaking BOSS's operation. If BOSS is run and it cannot find a BOSS.ini, it will generate a new one. If BOSS is run with both a BOSS.ini present and command line parameters set, the command line parameters override the settings in BOSS.ini. The ini is split into the following sections:
<h4>BOSS.GeneralSettings</h4>
<p>These settings control miscellaneous areas of BOSS's operation outside of the main sorting functionality.
<table>
	<thead><tr><td>Ini Setting<td>Default<td>Valid Values<td>Description
	<tbody>
		<tr><td>bDoStartupUpdateCheck<td><code>true</code><td><code>true</code>, <code>false</code><td>Controls whether or not BOSS's Automatic Updater checks for new releases when BOSS is run.
</table>
<h4>BOSS.InternetSettings</h4>
<p>These settings control how the masterlist updater and GUI auto-updater connect to the Internet. They are shared by BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe, and can be overriden for the masterlist updater using BOSS's command line parameters. They may also be edited through the GUI.

<h2 id="cli">Command Line Arguments</h2>
<p>The BOSS GUI acts as a frontend to BOSS, and its output and run options correspond to BOSS's command line arguments. The syntax for these arguments is:
<p><code>boss [-hVuosndctU] [-g [game]] [-r [level]] [-v [level]] [-f [type]] [-T [type]] [-H [hostname]] [-P [port]]</code>
<p><code>-h [ --help ]</code>
<p>This prints a short description of BOSS and some information on the function of the command line arguments, then exits.
<p><code>-V [ --version ]</code>
<p>Prints the a banner displaying the program name and version number to the command line, then exits.
<p><code>-u [ --update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then sorts your plugins. This behaviour is enabled by default, so the command line parameter will have no effect except when the automatic masterlist updating has been disabled in the ini.
<p><code>-o [ --only-update ]</code>
<p>Automatically updates the local copy of the masterlist using the latest version on the Google Code repository, and then does <b>not</b> sort your plugins.
<p><code>-g [ --game ] [ game ]</code>
<p>Overrides game autodetection. The valid values of the argument are: <code>Oblivion</code>, <code>Nehrim</code>, <code>Fallout3</code>, <code>FalloutNV</code> and <code>Skyrim</code>. If the game specified is not detected, BOSS will fail before any plugins are sorted, so this should be used in conjunction with -o.
<p><code>-s [ --silent ]</code>
<p>Stops BOSS from automatically opening up the BOSS Log in your web browser (or text editor, depending on format chosen) after it has finished running.
<p><code>-n [ --no-version-parse ]</code>
<p>Disables the parsing of each plugin's description to extract the author's version information, so it is not printed alongside the other data in the BOSS Log. This can be used if the version 
parsing is not working properly for some of your plugins and you wish to remove the version notes.
<p><code>-r [ --revert ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Revert to a previous load order. This parameter optionally accepts values of <code>1</code> or <code>2</code>, indicating how many undo steps to apply. If no option is specified, it defaults to <code>1</code>. A value of <code>1</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.txt. 
A value of <code>2</code> will restore the load order to that stored in modlist.old. If the modlist that you are reverting to does not exist, BOSS will cancel the undo and display an error message. The modlist files are not updated when BOSS is run with this parameter.
<p><code>-v [ --verbose ] [ level ]</code>
<p>Specify verbosity level (<code>0</code> to <code>3</code>). <code>0</code> is the default, showing only warning and error messages. <code>1</code> (warning, error and informational messages) is implied if this option is specified without an argument. Higher values increase the verbosity further.
<p><code>-d [ --debug ]</code>
<p>Adds source file references (filenames and line numbers) to logging statements.
<p><code>-c [ --crc-display ]</code>
<p>Calculates the <abbr title="Cyclic Redundancy Checks">CRCs</abbr> of all the plugins in your Data folder and displays them in your BOSS Log alongside the plugin names. The version numbers and CRCs of <abbr title="Oblivion Script Extender">OBSE</abbr>/<abbr title="Fallout Script Extender">FOSE</abbr>/<abbr title="New Vegas Script Extender">NVSE</abbr> and its installed plugins will also be displayed in your BOSS Log.
<p><code>-f [ --format ] [ type ]</code>
<p>Allows the selection of the BOSS Log format. Valid argument values are: <code>html</code> and <code>text</code>. <code>html</code> is the default output format. The <code>text</code> value will print the BOSS Log as plain text into a 'BOSSlog.txt' file, similar to the BOSS Log in BOSS v1.5 and below.
<p><code>-t [ --trial-run ]</code>
<p>BOSS runs, but no plugins are redated, so your load order is not changed. The BOSS Log still displays the order BOSS would have placed them in, so it is useful for checking what would happen if you ran BOSS on your load order without having to then undo BOSS's changes.
<p><code>-U [ --no-update ]</code>
<p>Inhibits the default automatic masterlist updater, preventing it from running. Must not be used alongside --update,-u.
<p><code>-T [ --proxy-type ] [ type ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy type for the masterlist updater. Valid values are: <code>direct</code>, <code>http</code>, <code>http1_0</code>, <code>socks4</code>, <code>socks4a</code>, <code>socks5</code> and <code>socks5h</code> (SOCKS 5 with proxy-based hostname resolution). <code>direct</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy. Other types of proxy are not currently supported.
<p><code>-H [ --proxy-host ] [ hostname ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy hostname for the masterlist updater. The hostname may be an actual hostname (eg. <code>proxy.company.com</code>), an IP address (eg. <code>192.168.32.4</code>) or <code>none</code>. <code>none</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.
<p><code>-P [ --proxy-port ] [ port ]</code>
<p>Sets the proxy port number for the masterlist updater. The port number may be any valid port number. <code>0</code> is the default, and is equivalent to there being no proxy.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="special">Updating Under Special Circumstances</h2>
<p>The vast majority of users will be able to use BOSS's masterlist updater and the GUI's auto-updater with no problems. However, some users' circumstances may be such that the standard method will not work. This section provides instructions for those users.
<p>The most common special circumstance is when the computer the user has BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet. Merely transferring BOSS.exe to another computer and running it is not sufficient, as by default BOSS tries to autodetect the game it is installed for, and if there is no game present it will exit with an error. In this circumstance, the following instructions should be used to obtain masterlist updates:
<ol>
	<li>Copy <q>BOSS.exe</q> and <q>BOSS GUI.exe</q> from your BOSS folder to the computer with an Internet connection, ensuring they are in the same folder.
	<li>If your Internet connection is through a proxy, you will also need to copy across your <q>BOSS.ini</q> to ensure the proxy settings you have recorded in it are applied. Make sure you have recorded your proxy settings in your BOSS.ini!
	<li>Run the BOSS GUI.exe and select the <q>Update Masterlist Only</q> option. For the <q>Game</q> option below, select your game from the drop-down list. This will tell BOSS which game's masterlist to download.
	<li>Select <q>Run BOSS</q>. Your masterlist will be downloaded into the same folder as your BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe. A BOSS Log will also be created, you can delete this.
</ol>
<p>A rarer circumstance is when the user connects to the Internet using a proxy. This is most common in enterprise environments, and such users will generally know if they use a proxy. If you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, you must manually enter your proxy settings into your <q>BOSS.ini</q> settings file. See the section on the BOSS.ini in the <q><a href="#customising">Customising How BOSS Works</a></q> section below for details. BOSS does not support the use of authenticated proxies at this time.
<p>If your circumstances are such that the computer you have BOSS installed on is not connected to the Internet, or if you use a proxy to connect to the Internet, it is recommended that you avoid using the GUI's auto-updater, simply because it is easier in these circumstances to download new releases through your web browser.
<p>There may also be other special cases which cause problems for BOSS's updaters that the BOSS team is unaware of. If you are having issues using the updaters, contact the BOSS team for support.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="linux">Running BOSS Under Linux</h2>
<p>It is possible to run BOSS on Linux through the Wine compatibility layer, though no official support for doing so is given. Installation and usage is as on Windows. 
It is also possible to compile BOSS natively for Linux, and makefiles are provided, although there is again no official support for doing so. Native Linux builds are case-sensitive in their recognition of plugins in the masterlist, and while plugins are generally added with the correct case, occasionally a plugin might have the incorrect case which would cause problems for a user with a native Linux build.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="files">BOSS Changes and Files</h2>
<p>The only changes BOSS makes to your game install are to re-date the .esp and .esm files in your Data folder, and create a few files in your BOSS folder. Your game's master file (Oblivion.esm, Nehrim.esm, Fallout3.esm, FalloutNV.esm or Skyrim.esm) is never altered, and all dates are derived from it.
<p>BOSS stores all its files in the BOSS folder. BOSS's files are detailed in the table below.

<div id="troubleshooting"><h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<p>Although BOSS is simple to use, it has grown to become a relatively complex application. As such, there are some circumstances under which BOSS may not be able to run correctly, due to a variety of possible reasons. In such cases, an error message detailing the problem should be provided. If the program unexpectedly crashes, or you experience 
a problem for which no error message is given, please report the crash or problem to an official BOSS thread (linked to in the <q><a href="#links">Quick Links</a></q> section below), so that we may fix it.
<p>If the information below does not help you to solve any problems you are experiencing, please seek further support in one of the official BOSS threads.</p>
<h2 id="general-issues">General Problems</h2>
<p>There are a few general reasons why BOSS may fail to function correctly. Check if any of the symptoms listed below fit your issue.
<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> No change in load order.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Wrye Bash's <q>Lock Times</q> load order locking feature is enabled.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Disable <q>Lock Times</q> before running BOSS. If you are using Wrye Bash v277 or later and running BOSS from Wrye Bash, this is done for you, and <q>Lock Times</q> is then re-activated after BOSS has run.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not change/update the BOSS Log and/or modlists correctly.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> The BOSS Log and/or modlists are read-only, or the BOSS folder is read-only.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Ensure that the BOSS folder and any files in it are not read-only.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Symptom:</b> BOSS does not recognise the plugins in my userlist correctly, and/or replaces some of the letters in their names with question marks.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Your userlist is not encoded in UTF-8.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Save your userlist in the UTF-8 encoding.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> You had plugins in your userlist with non-Latin letters in their names, and saved your userlist in a non-UTF8 encoding before saving it in UTF-8.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Rewrite the filenames in your userlist, copy/pasting them from the files themselves to ensure they are correct.
	</ul>
	
	<li><b>Symptom:</b> Some plugins have the wrong or no version number given in the BOSS Log.
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> This occurs because BOSS looks for the version number in the plugin's description field. If the plugin author has forgotten to update the version number there or not provided one, an incorrect or no version number will be displayed.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> No solution, other than the plugin author including a correct version number in the plugin's description field for a later release.
	</ul>
	
</ul>
<br />

<h2 id="permissions">File Permissions</h2>
<p>If you are running Windows Vista or Windows 7, BOSS (and other modding programs) may be prevented from working correctly by the UAC security feature. There are four common workarounds to this problem:
<ol>
	<li>Install the game outside the <q>Program Files</q> (or <q>Program Files (x86)</q> if on 64-bit Windows). UAC prevents unauthorised edits to these folders, so by installing the game outside of them, you remove it from UAC's reach, allowing you to use mods more easily.
	<li>Deactivate UAC. This can be done from the Control Panel, and will turn UAC off across the whole of your computer. It is up to you whether you feel that you have adequate security measures in place to do this without risk.
	<li>Give yourself <q>Full Control</q> permissions over your game install folder. This will allow you to make any edits you desire while keeping UAC active and on guard for any edits made by programs you do not run, and also means that you do not need to reinstall your game to a new location.
	<li>Run BOSS as an Administrator. Right-click the BOSS.exe, and select <q>Run as administrator</q>.
</ol>
<p>For those that wish to take the third option and give themselves <q>Full Control</q> permissions, here is a guide:
<ol>
	<li>Right-click the folder you wish to change the permissions for, and select <q>Properties</q>.
	<li>In <q>Properties</q>, select the <q>Security</q> tab, and click the <q>Edit...</q> button. A UAC prompt may appear, simply allow yourself to continue.
	<li>In the <q>Group or user names</q> box, select the <q>Users</q> option.
	<li>In the lower box, check the box opposite <q>Full Control</q> in the <q>Allow</q> column. Press OK to exit. If a UAC prompt appears, allow the change.
	<li>In the <q>Properties</q> window, select OK to exit. You should now have Full Control permissions over your chosen folder.
</ol>
<br />

<h2 id="international">International Character Support</h2>
<p>BOSS provides support for sorting plugins containing characters from any language via the Unicode character encoding, specifically UTF-8. All BOSS's files are encoded in UTF-8 by default. However, if you created your userlist.txt before BOSS automatically created one, you will probably need to convert it to the UTF-8 encoding, as it is not Notepad's default encoding. Below are some instructions for converting a file's encoding to UTF-8:
<ul>
	<li>Using Notepad:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
	
	<li>Using Notepad++:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad++.
			<li>Open the <q>Encoding</q> menu, then select <q>Convert to UTF-8</q>.
			<li>Save the file as normal.
		</ol>
	
</ul>
<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.</p>
<br />

<h2 id="errors">Error Messages</h2>
<p>If BOSS can detect a specific reason for being unable to function correctly, it will print an error message detailing the problem. BOSS's error messages are listed below, along with details of the issues and possible solutions. The list does not include any messages related to user rule application.
<ul>
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Error: file '<code>filename</code>' could not be accessed for writing.</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS does not have permission to write to the given file if it exists.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that the file, if it exists, is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <q><a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a></q> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Critical Error: Oblivion.esm and Nehrim.esm have both been found!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> You have installed Nehrim incorrectly.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Uninstall Nehrim, read its Readme, then re-install it correctly.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Critical Error: Master .ESM file not found!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS is not being run in the correct folder.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Move the BOSS folder containing all of BOSS's files into your game's installation folder, which is the one that contains the Data folder.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Your master .ESM file is deactivated and ghosted by Wrye Bash/Flash/Flash NV.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-activate your master .ESM file.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Error: Masterlist update failed.</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Detail:</b> Invalid proxy hostname or port specified.
		<li><b>Detail:</b> Invalid proxy type specified.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Your proxy settings in your <q>BOSS.ini</q> are invalid. Correct them before attempting to check for updates again.
		<li><b>Detail:</b> Curl could not be initialised.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> No specific solution. Try again later.
		<li><b>Detail:</b> None of the supported games were detected.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> This error message should never be displayed. Contact the BOSS development team for support.
		<li><b>Detail:</b> Cannot find online masterlist revision number.
		<li><b>Detail:</b> Cannot find online masterlist revision date.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Contact the BOSS development team for support. This message means that either the layout of the download page has changed or you are using a proxy that is blocking or malformatting the page.
		<li><b>Detail:</b> Masterlist cannot be opened.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure that your BOSS folder (and masterlist.txt if it exists) is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <q><a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a></q> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Other network error.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> There was a problem in getting information from the Internet. Depending on the error given, make sure your Internet connection is working correctly, or try again later. If you use a proxy make sure that the proxy service is running and that you have the proxy settings recorded in your <q>BOSS.ini</q>.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>No Internet connection detected. Masterlist auto-updater aborted.</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If you are certain that you do have an Internet connection, it could be because you use a proxy to connect to the Internet. Enter your proxy connection details into the relevant parts of the <q>BOSS.ini</q> and try again. 
		If you are unsure whether you are using a proxy and are trying to use BOSS in an enterprise environment, contact your network administrator for your proxy details. If you continue to have difficulty or are not using a proxy, contact the BOSS development team for further support.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Critical Error: Master .ESM file cannot be read!</i>

		<li><b>Solution:</b> If this error is displayed, it means that your master .ESM file exists, but its date cannot be read. This can only take place under very specialised circumstances, such as corruption of your master .ESM file, and probably means you will have to seek expert help.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Critical Error: Modlist backup failed!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Detail:</b> Modlist backup cannot be saved.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> Other filesystem error.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Check that the file is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <q><a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a></q> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Critical Error: "<code>filename</code>" cannot be read!</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS cannot find your masterlist.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If you have disabled the automatic masterlist updater, enable it and run BOSS again to download the masterlist to the correct location.
		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS cannot find the specified modlist backup.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Make sure the modlist for the undo level you have specified exists. A level 1 undo requires <q>modlist.txt</q> and a level 2 undo requires <q>modlist.old</q> to be present.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Critical Error: "<code>filename</code>" is not encoded in valid UTF-8. Please save the file using the UTF-8 encoding.</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Issue:</b> If <code>filename</code> is "userlist.txt", BOSS has detected that your userlist.txt is saved using the wrong encoding, and is unable to read it.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save the file given in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. If you are unsure on how to do so, follow these instructions:
		<ol>
			<li>Open the file in Notepad.
			<li>Open the <q>File</q> menu, then select <q>Save As...</q>.
			<li>In the <q>Save As</q> dialog window that opens, there is a drop-down list labelled <q>Encoding:</q>. Select <q>UTF-8</q> from this list. Do <b>not</b> select any of the other Unicode encodings, they will not work.
			<li>Click the <q>Save</q> button, answering <q>Yes</q> to any confirmation prompts.
		</ol>
		<p>A file only needs to be converted to the correct encoding once, thereafter it will continue to save in the correct encoding whenever you edit it.
		
		<li><b>Issue:</b> If <code>filename</code> is not "userlist.txt", BOSS is not functioning correctly.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Re-save the file given in the correct "UTF-8" encoding. Report this to the BOSS development team.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Error: <code>filename</code> generation failed. Ensure your BOSS folder is not read-only.</i>
	<ul>
		<li><b>Solution:</b> Check that the file is not read-only, and that you have write permissions. See the <q><a href="#permissions">File Permissions</a></q> section for details on how to obtain write permissions on Windows Vista or 7.
	</ul>
	
	<li style="margin-bottom:1.4em;"><b>Message:</b> <i>Error: Could not change the date of "<code>filename</code>", make sure you have write access to it.</i>

		<li><b>Issue:</b> BOSS failed to parse one of your files, either the <q>BOSS.ini</q>, the <q>masterlist.txt</q> or the <q>userlist.txt</q>.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If the <code>File</code> is "Masterlist" and you have not edited your masterlist, report the error to the BOSS development team.
		<li><b>Solution:</b> If the <code>File</code> is not "Masterlist", double check your changes to the file and correct the error. The message may or may not give useful details, and will probably display multiple messages for each fault.

<div id="history"><h1>Version History</h1>
<p>The changelogs for each release of BOSS are listed below. The masterlists are updated far too frequently for their changes to be concisely recorded here, but a full history of changes to them may be viewed by browsing the Google Code repository.
<p><b>Version 1.8.1</b> - <i>2011</i>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed: A bug where if a plugin filename started with "SET" or "GLOBAL" (or case variations) then BOSS would incorrectly classify it as a variable or global message line and so result in syntax errors.
	<li>Fixed: User Rules which failed to add a plugin into the beginning or end of a group still incremented the number of recognised plugins as if the rule application had succeeded.
	<li>Changed: Added whitespace characters between plugin filenames, versions, ghosted labels and CRCs to make plaintext more readable.
	<li>Changed: Userlist rules which reference plugins that are not installed now have warning messages reported instead of error messages.
	<li>Changed: Masterlist keywords can now be case-insensitive.
	<li>Changed: Content and slight formatting changes to BOSS Log:
	<ul>
		<li><q>Masterlist Update</q> section removed. Update information is now displayed in the <q>Summary</q> section. Updater errors are displayed in the <q>General Messages</q> section.
		<li>Javascript optimisations for filters. Probably no noticeable performance impact unless the user has a very large load order.
		<li><q>Execution Complete</q> text is now centred.
		<li>Other behind-the-scenes tweaks.
	</ul>
	<li>Added: <q>Hide Clean Mods</q> BOSS Log filter.
	<li>Added: Support for Skyrim. This assumes Skyrim's master file will be <q>Skyrim.esm</q>, the executable will be <q>Skyrim.exe</q>. If different, BOSS will be updated upon Skyrim's release with the real filenames.
	<li>Added: Support for a Skyrim Script Extender. While the team responsible for OBSE, FOSE and NVSE have not made any comments officially or unofficially regarding Skyrim, BOSS has added support for one with the assumptions that it uses the <code>Data\SKSE\Plugins\</code> directory for its plugins and has a loader named <q>skse_loader.exe</q>.
	<li>Added: Support for MF2.2 C-style comments, case-insensitive keywords and expanded conditional shorthands.
	<li>Added: Masterlist updater download progress indication in command line window.
	<li>(Docs) Changed: Main readme updated to reflect changes.
	<li>(Docs) Added: Masterlist Syntax HTML documentation for BOSS team members and interested third parties.
</ul>
<p><b>Version 1.8</b> - <i>6 July 2011</i>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed: Junction-linked data folders not being scanned for plugins.
	<li>Fixed: Links being displayed incorrectly in the BOSSlog if more than one was given in a message.
	<li>Changed: Masterlist updater now runs by default.
	<li>Changed: Updated version of libcurl used when building BOSS.exe and BOSS GUI.exe to 7.21.7 from 7.21.4.
	<li>Changed: Overhauled the <q>Plugin Numbers</q> section of the BOSSlog:
	<ul>
		<li>Moved the section to the top of the BOSSlog.
		<li>Renamed the section from <q>Plugin Numbers</q> to <q>Summary</q>.
		<li>Added message counts, with numbers of total messages, warning messages and error messages.
		<li>Added a notice that is displayed when there has been no change in the recognised plugin list since BOSS was last run.
	</ul>
	
	<li>Added: A settings file (<q>BOSS.ini</q>) to allow users to set default behaviours, options and BOSSlog formatting styles.
	<li>Added: Support for unauthenticated proxies to the masterlist updater and the GUI's <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality.
	<li>Added: Five new command line parameters:
	<ul>
		<li><code>--proxy-host,-H [ hostname ]</code> to specify a proxy's host server for the masterlist updater.
		<li><code>--proxy-port,-P [ port ]</code> to specify a proxy's port for the masterlist updater.
		<li><code>--proxy-type,-T [ type ]</code> to specify a proxy type for the masterlist updater.
		<li><code>--trial-run,-t</code> to run BOSS without actually changing the load order.
		<li><code>--no-update,-U</code> to inhibit automatic masterlist updating.
	</ul>
	
	<li>Added: Support for Fallout: New Vegas plugins that use the Fallout 3 master file, such as <q>A Requiem for the Capital Wasteland</q>.
	<li>Added: Support for MF2.1 regular expressions in the masterlist.
	<li>Added: Support for MF2.1 conditional incompatibility and conditional requirement messages in the masterlist.
	<li>Added: BOSSlog filter option to hide userlist warning messages.
	<li>(GUI) Fixed: The <q>Enable File CRC Display</q> and <q>Enable Mod Version Display</q> options getting confused between their values under the <q>Sort Mods</q> and <q>Undo Changes</q> run options.
	<li>(GUI) Fixed: The icon not appearing in the title bar.
	<li>(GUI) Fixed: The GUI hanging when BOSS is launched.
	<li>(GUI) Changed: The <q>Masterlist Update</q> checkbox now sets the --no-update command line parameter if unchecked to override BOSS's default behaviour.
	<li>(GUI) Changed: The look of the <q>About</q> window.
	<li>(GUI) Changed: Overhauled the <q>Check For Updates</q> functionality:
	<ul>
		<li>Removed the masterlist update checker, as it has been made redundant by BOSS's automatic masterlist updating.
		<li>Added automatic updater functionality. Replaced <q>Check For Updates</q> output window with a series of notification dialogs asking if the update should be downloaded and installed. If no update was found, or there was an error, relevant dialog messages are displayed.
		<li><q>Check For Updates</q> now also automatically runs when the GUI starts. This only displays a message if an update was found.
	</ul>
	
	<li>(GUI) Changed: Renamed a number of options, simplifying their names slightly.
	<li>(GUI) Changed: Options selected are now saved on exit and loaded on start.
	<li>(GUI) Added: <q>Perform Trial Run</q> option.
	<li>(GUI) Added: Settings page for specifying how the GUI behaves.
	<li>(Installer) Changed: Updated to reflect various changes to programs.
	<li>(Installer) Changed: Installer now runs uninstaller before installing if a previous installation of BOSS is found.
	<li>(Docs) Changed: Significant content and formatting changes to main ReadMe, slight formatting changes to User Rules readme.
</ul>
<p><b>Version 1.7</b> - <i>10 June 2011</i>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed: A bug in the masterlist updater causing the wrong masterlist version to be displayed.
	<li>Changed: Ghosted plugins must now be referenced in user rules without their ".ghost" extension.
	<li>Changed: Moved all BOSS's files into a new BOSS folder, located in the game's installation directory, one level above the Data folder.
	<li>Changed: Switched to using the Unicode character encoding, allowing the sorting of plugins with international characters in their names.
	<ul>
		<li>BOSS now uses the UTF-8 encoding for all its operations.
		<li>All BOSS files must now be encoded in UTF-8: this includes the modlists, masterlist and userlist.
		<li>Converted the masterlists and modlists to use the UTF-8 encoding.
		<li>Added a UTF-8 validator to ensure that the correct encoding for the required files is being used.
	</ul>
	
	<li>Changed: Removed batch files as they are no longer necessary.
	<li>Changed: The release date of updated masterlists is now displayed beside the revision number in the BOSSlog.
	<li>Changed: Significant rewrite of source code, resulting in performance gains.
	<li>Changed: Implemented new file parsers for the masterlist, modlists and userlist.
	<li>Changed: Improved the formatting of the BOSSlog, making it more readable.
	<li>Changed: Links in the BOSSlog are now hyperlinks that can be clicked on to take you to the given URL.
	<li>Added: A unique icon to the executables, made by Hickory.

	<li>Added: Display of the numbers of recognised, unrecognised, ghosted and total plugins to the end of the BOSSlog.
	<li>Added: Javascript-based filter options and collapsible sections to the BOSSlog.
	<li>Added: A Graphical User Interface (GUI) that can be used to launch BOSS with whatever options are desired without having to use the command line.
	<li>Added: Three new command line parameters:
	<ul>
		<li><code>--game,-g [ game ]</code> to override game autodetection. To be used in conjunction with -o to allow updating of the masterlist on computers where the specified game is not installed.
		<li><code>--crc-display,-c</code> to calculate and display in the BOSSlog the CRCs of all your plugins. CRCs can be used as accurate version checks in masterlist conditionals.
		<li><code>--format,-f [ type ]</code> to select the BOSSlog format, choosing from either HTML or plaintext. HTML formatting is the default.
	</ul>
	
	<li>(Installer) Changed: Updated installer to reflect the various changes to BOSS's files and folders.
	<li>(Docs) Changed: Significant content and formatting changes to main ReadMe, slight formatting changes to User Rules readme.
</ul>

	<li>Fixed: Non-ASCII characters in plugin filenames causing crashes.
	<li>Changed: Slight improvements to user rule error reporting when sorting groups that do not exist.
	<li>Added: <code>--only-update,-o</code> command line parameter to only update the masterlist without then sorting any plugins.
	<li>Added: <q>BOSS - Print Debug Info.bat</q> file to make debugging of BOSS errors simpler.
	<li>Added: Nullsoft Scriptable Install installer for simpler BOSS installation.
</ul>
<p><b>Version 1.63</b> - <i>15 November 2010</i>
<ul>
	<li>Fixed: Crashing when updating the masterlist if downloading an incorrectly formatted masterlist.
