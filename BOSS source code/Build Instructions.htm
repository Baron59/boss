	<h1>BOSS - Better Oblivion Sorting Software (and BOSS-F)<br />Build Instructions</h1>
	
	<p>This guide presumes that you are building on Windows. If not, presumably you are experienced enough to know what you're doing. 
	If after following this guide, you are still having trouble compiling BOSS, feel free to PM pacificmorrowind or WrinklyNinja for help.</p>
	
	<h3>Preparing Your Environment/Getting Prerequisites</h3>
	<p><h4>Download and install:</h4><ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/">Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition</a> (if you've already got Visual Studio, just use that)</li>
	<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.43.0/">BOOST C++ libraries</a></li>
	<li>An SVN client of your choice.</li>
	</ul>If you're wanting to build BOSS, and not just BOSS-F, you will also need:<ul>
	<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx">Windows SDK</a> - You only need to install the "x86 Libraries" and "Windows Headers" from the "Windows Headers And Libraries" section.</li>
	<li><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">Curl Source Code</a> - Download the latest zipped source code from the top of the page.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Preparing BOSS and BOOST</h4><ol>
	<li>Perform a SVN Checkout from <a href="https://better-oblivion-sorting-software.googlecode.com/svn">https://better-oblivion-sorting-software.googlecode.com/svn</a>
	to a local directory of your own choice to create your working copy. (This directory shall be referred to as $BOSS from here on in.)</li>
	<li>Extract the BOOST libaries archive you downloaded to $BOSS\BOSS source code\$BOOST_ROOT where $BOOST_ROOT is the root of the archive extracted.</li>
	<li>Start a Command Prompt and cd to $BOSS\BOSS source code\$BOOST_ROOT and run <code>bootstrap.bat</code></li>
    <li>Edit the file project-config.jam in $BOSS\BOSS source code\$BOOST_ROOT to refer to your version of Visual Studio - for
    Visual Studio 2010 this is <code>using msvc : 10.0 ; </code>. (For Visual Studio 2008, it would be <code>using msvc : 9.0 ; </code>)</li>
	<li>In the Command Prompt, run <code>bjam.exe --build-type=complete</code>. This will take a while. Once that is done, you are ready to build BOSS.</li></ol></p>
	
	<h4>Preparing Curl dependency (not required for building BOSS-F)</h4>
	<p>We are going to be building the curl requirements from source, since the Windows curl packages are often not up-to-date. We don't need to compile all of curl though, just the static library. 
	To do so, follow these steps:<ol>
	<li>Extract the curl archive to $BOSS\BOSS source code\curl (there should be the README file, etc in this directory, not a curl-x.xx.x folder).</li>
	<li>Open the libcurl.vcproj file found in $BOSS\BOSS source code\curl\lib in Visual C++ 2010.</li>
	<li>Set the build type to Release. In Project->Properties->Configuration Properties->C/C++->Code Generation, set the Runtime Library to "Multi-threaded (/MT)".</li>
	<li>Build the libcurl project. This will create a libcurl.lib file in the lib/Release directory.</li></ol></p><br />
	
	<h3>Building BOSS</h3>
	<p>Open $BOSS\BOSS source code\BOSS.sln in Visual C++ 2010, then select the desired build type (Release or Debug) and run Build on whichever project(s) you are interested in, or just run Build All.
	The generated exe(s) will be located in $BOSS\BOSS source code\%BUILDTYPE%\</p>
