	<h1>Dirty List Generator: Build Instructions</h1>
	
	<p>This guide presumes that you are building on Windows. If not, presumably you are experienced enough to know what you're doing. 
	If after following this guide, you are still having trouble compiling the Dirty List Generator, feel free to PM WrinklyNinja for help.<br /><br />
	This guide also assumes that you are building the 'trunk' of the dirty-list-generator code. If you are building a branch, change all references to 
	<code>trunk\</code> to the directory that contains the DirtyListGenerator.sln file of the code you are building.</p><br />
	
	<h3>Preparing Your Environment/Getting Prerequisites</h3>
	<h4>Download and install:</h4>
	<ul>
		<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/">Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition</a></li>
		<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.46.1/">BOOST C++ libraries</a> - BOSS requires version 1.46.1, it will not work with earlier versions, later versions can be tried, but might also break something.</li>
		<li>An SVN client of your choice.</li>
	</ul><br />
	
	<h4>Preparing BOSS and BOOST</h4>
	<ol>
		<li>Perform a SVN Checkout from <a href="https://better-oblivion-sorting-software.googlecode.com/svn">https://better-oblivion-sorting-software.googlecode.com/svn</a>
		to a local directory of your own choice to create your working copy. (This directory shall be referred to as <em>$BOSS</em> from here on in.)</li>
		<li>Extract the contents of the <code>boost-x.xx.x</code> (x is a number) folder in the BOOST libaries archive you downloaded to <code><em>$BOSS</em>\lib\boost\</code> (you should have lib, include, boostrap.bat, etc. in this folder).</li>
		<li>Start a Command Prompt and cd to <code><em>$BOSS</em>\lib\boost</code> and run <code>bootstrap.bat</code></li>
		<li>In the Command Prompt, run <code>bjam --toolset=msvc-10.0 --build-type=complete</code> . This will take a while. Once that is done, you may close the Command Prompt window.</li>
	</ol><br />
	
	<h3>Building the Dirty List Generator</h3>
	<ol>
		<li>Open <code><em>$BOSS</em>\code\dirty-list-generator\trunk\DirtyListGenerator.sln</code> in Visual C++ 2010.</li>
		<li>Set the build type to "Release" and run Build on the DirtyListGenerator project, which will give you dirtylistgenerator.exe. Alternatively, run Debug->Build Solution to do the same.</li>
		<li>The generated exe(s) will be located in <code><em>$BOSS</em>\code\dirty-list-generator\trunk\bin\Release\</code>.</li>
