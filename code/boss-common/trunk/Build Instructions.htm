	<h1>BOSS - Better Oblivion Sorting Software<br />Build Instructions</h1>
	
	<p>This guide presumes that you are building on Windows. If not, presumably you are experienced enough to know what you're doing. 
	If after following this guide, you are still having trouble compiling BOSS, feel free to PM pacificmorrowind or WrinklyNinja for help.</p>
	
	<h3>Preparing Your Environment/Getting Prerequisites</h3>
	<p><h4>Download and install:</h4><ul>
	<li><a href="http://www.microsoft.com/express/">Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Express Edition</a> (if you've already got Visual Studio, just use that)</li>
	<li><a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/bb980924.aspx">Windows SDK</a> - You only need to install the "x86 Libraries" and "Windows Headers" from the "Windows Headers And Libraries" section.</li>
	<li><a href="http://curl.haxx.se/download.html">Curl Source Code</a> - Download the latest zipped source code from the top of the page.</li>
	<li><a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/boost/files/boost/1.43.0/">BOOST C++ libraries</a></li>
	<li>An SVN client of your choice.</li>
	</ul>
	<h4>Preparing BOSS and BOOST</h4><ol>
	<li>Perform a SVN Checkout from <a href="https://better-oblivion-sorting-software.googlecode.com/svn">https://better-oblivion-sorting-software.googlecode.com/svn</a>
	to a local directory of your own choice to create your working copy. (This directory shall be referred to as <em>$BOSS</em> from here on in.)</li>
	<li>Extract the BOOST libaries archive you downloaded to <em>$BOSS\</em>code\boss-common\trunk\boost. (The extracted archive has normally a "boos_n_mm" directory, <em>'n'</em> and <em>'mm'</em> are version numbers, but you should rename it to simply "boost") </li>
	<li>Start a Command Prompt and cd to <code><em>$BOSS\</em>code\boss-common\trunk\boost</code> and run <code>bootstrap.bat</code></li>
    <li>Edit the file project-config.jam in <code><em>$BOSS\</em>code\boss-common\trunk\boost</code> to refer to your version of Visual Studio - for
    Visual Studio 2010 this is <code>using msvc : 10.0 ; </code>. (For Visual Studio 2008, it would be <code>using msvc : 9.0 ; </code>)</li>
	<li>In the Command Prompt, run <code>bjam.exe --build-type=complete</code>. This will take a while. Once that is done, you are ready to build BOSS.</li></ol></p>
	
	<h4>Preparing Curl dependency</h4>
	<p>We are going to be building the curl requirements from source, since the Windows curl packages are often not up-to-date. We don't need to compile all of curl though, just the static library. 
	To do so, follow these steps:<ol>
	<li>Extract the curl archive to <code><em>$BOSS</em>\code\boss-common\trunk\curl</code> (there should be the README file, etc in this directory, not a curl-x.xx.x folder).</li>
	<li>Open the libcurl.vcproj file found in <code><em>$BOSS\</em>code\boss-common\trunk\curl\lib</code> in Visual C++ 2010.</li>
	<li>Set the build type to Release. In Project->Properties->Configuration Properties->C/C++->Code Generation, set the Runtime Library to "Multi-threaded (/MT)".</li>
	<li>Build the libcurl project. This will create a libcurl.lib file in the lib/Release directory.</li></ol></p><br />
	
	<h3>Building BOSS</h3>
	<p>Open <code><em>$BOSS\</em>code\boss-common\trunk\BOSS.sln</code> in Visual C++ 2010, then select the desired build type (Release or Debug) and run Build on the Common project (it works for Oblivion, Fallout 3 and Morrowind), or just run Build All.
	The generated exe(s) will be located in <code><em>$BOSS\</em>code\boss-common\trunk\<em>%BUILDTYPE%</em>\</code> If you are building for Fallout, you may rename the generated exe to BOSS-F.exe.</p>
