<h1>BOSS CLI: Build Instructions</h1>

<p>This guide presumes that you are building on Windows. If not, presumably you are experienced enough to know what you're doing. 
If after following this guide, you are still having trouble compiling BOSS, feel free to PM WrinklyNinja for help.<br /><br />
This guide also assumes that you are building the 'trunk' of the boss-common code. If you are building a branch, change all references to 
<code>trunk\</code> to the directory that contains the BOSS.sln file of the code you are building.</p>

<p style="font-weight:bold;">These instructions assume that you have already built the boss-common trunk to produce a BOSS.lib, which is required.

<h3>Preparing Your Environment/Getting Prerequisites</h3>

<h4>Download and install:</h4>

 <li>An SVN client of your choice.
</ul>

<h4>Preparing BOSS</h4>

 <li>Perform a SVN Checkout from <a href="https://better-oblivion-sorting-software.googlecode.com/svn">https://better-oblivion-sorting-software.googlecode.com/svn</a>

</ol>

<h3>Building BOSS</h3>
<ol>
 <li>Open <code><em>$BOSS</em>\code\boss-common\trunk\BOSS-CLI.sln</code> in Visual C++ 2010.
 <li>Set the build type to "Release" and run Build on the BOSS-CLI project, which will give you a BOSS.exe in <code>bin\Release</code>.
